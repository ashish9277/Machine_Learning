But with that pact about to expire on Dec. 31, Nokia wants Apple to keep paying for that portfolio, and is demanding that Apple license additional patents. Apple is refusing to pay Nokia’s price and has accused it of extortion.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"167\" data-total-count=\"1041\">The impasse, after two years of tense negotiations, broke into <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2016/12/21/business/21reuters-nokia-corp-apple-patent.html\">open warfare</a> this week in a <a href=\"http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2016/12/22/nokia-expands-patent-litigation-against-apple-in-asia-europe-and-the-us\">volley of lawsuits in 11 countries</a>, including the United States and Germany.</p>        <a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-1\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n",

It also shows how cellphone pioneers like Nokia, Ericsson of Sweden and Motorola, whose patents are now owned by Google, are still trying to profit from the industry in which they are now bit players, at best.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"365\" data-total-count=\"2012\">“Obviously, the iPhone was not created on a green field but was built on what others created before Apple,” said Florian Mueller, a German iPhone app developer and former consultant to technology companies who has followed the cellphone patent wars. “On the other hand, the iPhone was a paradigm shift. It was more of a mobile computer than a mobile phone.”</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"447\" data-total-count=\"2459\">Patent disputes are common in the technology industry. This month, for instance, Samsung won a partial victory over Apple when the United States Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/technology/samsung-apple-smartphone-patent-supreme-court.html\">ruled</a> that it should not have to give up all of its phone profits for copying the look of Apple’s iPhone. Google, part of Alphabet, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/technology/google-oracle-copyright-code.html\">won a similar case</a> against Oracle in May after it was accused of copying software code used for Android, the search giant’s smartphone operating system.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"62\" data-total-count=\"2521\">But the tactics are evolving as the law and technology change.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"248\" data-total-count=\"2769\">When the Supreme Court a decade ago <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/15/washington/15cnd-bizcourt.html\">limited the leverage</a> that patent owners had to stop sales of a product that violated their patents, it empowered patent users to play hardball in negotiations, Mr. Roberts, the intellectual property lawyer, said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"381\" data-total-count=\"3150\">Companies like Nokia and Ericsson, which once had an interest in exchanging mutual licenses with other companies for their own cellphone businesses, left the handset market and concentrated on other tech gear and licensing their old patents. Nokia and Ericsson each make more than a billion dollars a year from licensing their patents and brands globally, their annual reports say.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"263\" data-total-count=\"3413\">Nokia has split its patent portfolio and transferred slices to so-called patent trolls — a derisive term for companies that buy others’ intellectual property and often file lawsuits to extract royalties from patent users — with Nokia sharing in any profits.</p><figure id=\"media-100000004837193\" class=\"media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004837193 ratio-tall\" data-media-action=\"modal\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/23/business/23PHONE2/23PHONE2-master675.jpg\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\">\n",

In September, Acacia won a <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/16/apple-ordered-to-pay-22-million-acacia/\">$22.1 million jury verdict</a> against Apple, and last week, Conversant <a href=\"https://www.law360.com/articles/871944/breaking-apple-hit-with-7-3m-verdict-in-core-wireless-patent-suit\">won </a><a href=\"https://www.law360.com/articles/871944/breaking-apple-hit-with-7-3m-verdict-in-core-wireless-patent-suit\"> $7.3 million</a>.</p><div id=\"story-ad-2\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent\">\n",

      "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"290\" data-total-count=\"4211\" id=\"story-continues-4\">“Unfortunately, Nokia has refused to license their patents on a fair basis and is now using the tactics of a patent troll to attempt to extort money from Apple by applying a royalty rate to Apple’s own inventions they had nothing to do with,” Apple said in a statement about the case.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"340\" data-total-count=\"4551\">In response, Nokia filed legal cases against Apple in 14 venues, from Texas to Japan, on Wednesday and Thursday, accusing it of violating 40 patents. Nokia said it had reached patent deals with more than 100 other companies, including many smartphone makers, which demonstrated that it had offered its intellectual property at a fair price.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"231\" data-total-count=\"4782\">“After several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple’s use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights,” Ilkka Rahnasto, the head of Nokia’s patent business, said in a statement.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"161\" data-total-count=\"4943\">Analysts say there is no doubt that Nokia owns important patents, which include those related to how phones transmit data and how their batteries consume energy.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"257\" data-total-count=\"5200\">Ericsson, which also had a longstanding legal dispute with Apple before they <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/ericsson-apple-settle-patent-dispute-1450700464\">agreed to a new licensing deal</a> last year, similarly has a large portfolio of patents — including technology for how smartphones make calls and how video is beamed onto a handset.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"267\" data-total-count=\"5467\">“Unless there’s a fair return on this technology, the whole model for the telecom world is at risk,” Gustav Brismark, Ericsson’s chief intellectual property officer, said. He added that the company had invested billions of dollars over decades in its patents.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"210\" data-total-count=\"5677\">In the past, Mr. Brismark said, companies quickly reached agreements over how to use Ericsson’s patents. But in the past five years, companies like Apple have more often turned to courts to reach settlements.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"400\" data-total-count=\"6077\">Central to the latest dispute between Apple and Nokia is what is a fair and reasonable fee to use Nokia technology that is now part of every smartphone. Patent lawyers say there has been a tradition of charging a modest royalty for patents on standard technologies. Previously, Nokia <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-samsung-elec-arbitration-idUSKCN0VA1IO\"> fought</a> bitter legal battles with other smartphone makers, including Samsung and LG, over how they used its patents.</p><div id=\"story-ad-3\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent\">\n",

      "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"416\" data-total-count=\"6493\" id=\"story-continues-5\">As Nokia seeks to require Apple to pay to license more of its patents, some of its recent claims may be hard to justify. In one of its lawsuits filed on Wednesday, it says Apple is violating a patent Nokia received two months ago for an electronic device case that includes a hole for a camera lens in the back and room for a battery beneath the display, features that have been common to smartphones for many years.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"254\" data-total-count=\"6747\">Still, Mr. Roberts said American courts have been skeptical of patent-related antitrust claims like those by Apple. “The whole point of the government granting these patents is that it was giving the inventor a monopoly over that invention,” he said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"88\" data-total-count=\"6835\">But Apple and Nokia are fighters, and too much is at stake for either to give up easily.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"173\" data-total-count=\"7008\">“What is a fair return on technology that has been shared with everyone?” Mr. Brismark of Ericsson said. “You have to create the right incentives for tech pioneers.”</p><footer class=\"story-footer story-content\">\n",

The company announced last week that nine D.C.-area store managers were fired after being accused of tampering with store bonuses paid to employees. The managers, at stores in Maryland, Virginia and D.C., were reportedly gaming the chain\\u2019s \\u201cgainsharing\\u201d program, which awards bonuses to employees whose departments come in under budget.  [Whole Foods accused of cheating workers out of bonuses in class-action lawsuit]  Then, on Tuesday, one current and one former employee of the P Street NW Whole Foods in the District filed a federal class-action lawsuit against the company, saying it cheated them out of gainsharing bonuses. The lawsuit alleged that the company avoided paying gainsharing bonuses by shifting labor costs to other departments and that the practice existed nationwide. Now the nine fired managers are suing the grocery chain, alleging wrongful termination over gainsharing and defamation. \\u201cWhole Foods, which touts itself as an employee friendly corporation, engaged in a nationwide practice to subvert earned employee bonuses,\\u201d says the lawsuit, filed in D.C. Superior Court on Tuesday. \\u201cWhen confronted with the systemic wage theft, Whole Foods attempted to cover up the corporate fraud and wage theft by terminating the nine whistleblower Plaintiffs.\\u201d Whole Foods issued a short statement in response. \\u201cThese allegations are not consistent with the findings to date of our internal investigations and we will respond appropriately,\\u201d it said. Since news of gainsharing problems broke, Whole Foods has said they were isolated to a small number of its 457 stores. \\u201cWe took swift action, but, relative to the rest of the company, this manipulation only happened in nine of our locations,\\u201d spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said last week. But in their suit, the former managers \\u2014 at the Whole Foods store on P Street NW and ones in Arlington; Bethesda; Vienna; Gaithersburg, Md.; Reston, Va.; Columbia, Md.; and Charlottesville \\u2014 allege that shifting labor costs to avoid gainsharing payments is a \\u201cnation-wide, corporate practice\\u201d that \\u201ceffectively stole the earned bonuses for countless employees across the country.\\u201d \\u201cWhole Foods needed proverbial fall guys,\\u201d the suit says. \\u201c .\\u2009.\\u2009. Whole Foods retaliated against Plaintiffs by wrongfully terminating all of them.\\u201d The managers were fired Dec. 1, with the lawsuit alleging defamation by Whole Foods because of subsequent stories by the Associated Press, ABC News and The Washington Post. Their suit asks for $20 million in punitive damages, among other relief. In an email, Nadeem Sheikh, a plaintiff who was a manager at Reston\\u2019s Whole Foods, said he worked for the company for 12 years and that shifting labor costs occurred during that entire period \\u201cat most, if not all, Whole Foods stores.\\u201d \\u201cThis is devastating to me and my family,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cI dedicated my career to Whole Foods.

(Stephen Lam/Reuters)  Mark Zuckerberg has a new housemate: Jarvis, an artificial intelligence assistant\\xa0he created this year that can control appliances, play music, recognize faces and,\\xa0perhaps most impressively, entertain his toddler. The Facebook founder\\xa0spent 100 hours putting together the\\xa0virtual assistant \\u2014 named after the artificial intelligence system in \\u201cIron Man\\u201d \\u2014 which understands spoken commands as well as text messages, he wrote in a 3,000-word Facebook\\xa0post Monday. Among\\xa0Jarvis\\u2019s skills: adjusting the home thermostat, turning on lights and operating the toaster. The virtual assistant texts Zuckerberg images of visitors who stop by during the day and opens the front door for those it recognizes. It can also tell when Zuckerberg\\u2019s 1-year-old daughter, Max, wakes up \\u201cso it can start playing music or a Mandarin lesson,\\u201d he wrote. In a tongue-in-cheek video he posted Tuesday on Facebook, Zuckerberg offers an example of Jarvis at work: \\u201cMax woke up a few minutes ago. I\\u2019m entertaining her,\\u201d the virtual assistant\\xa0(voiced by Morgan Freeman) tells Zuckerberg, before turning his attention to the toddler. \\u201cGood morning Max, let\\u2019s practice our Mandarin.\\u201d    [Mark Zuckerberg outlines Facebook\\u2019s ideas to battle fake news]   The year-long project was part of an effort to learn about the state of artificial intelligence, Zuckerberg wrote, and also an opportunity to experiment with\\xa0cutting-edge technology at a time when voice-activated assistants like Amazon\\u2019s Echo and Google Home are gaining widespread popularity. (Amazon.com founder Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) At this point, I mostly just ask Jarvis to \\u201cplay me some music\\u201d and by looking at my past listening patterns, it mostly nails something I\\u2019d want to hear. If it gets the mood wrong, I can just tell it, for example, \\u201cthat\\u2019s not light, play something light\\u201d, and it can both learn the classification for that song and adjust immediately. It also knows whether I\\u2019m talking to it or Priscilla is, so it can make recommendations based on what we each listen to. In general, I\\u2019ve found we use these more open-ended requests more frequently than more specific asks. No commercial products I know of do this today, and this seems like a big opportunity.   [Google\\u2019s smart home hub is promising, but still a work in progress]   Building the robot was the easier \\u2014 and less time-consuming \\u2014 of his two goals for the year, he said. The other was to run 365 miles in 2016. \\u201cNow I have a pretty good system that understands me and can do lots of things,\\u201d Zuckerberg, adding that he\\u2019s tried to give his robot a sense of humor. \\u201cI\\u2019ve taught it fun little games like Priscilla or I can ask it who we should tickle and it will randomly tell our family to all go tickle one of us, Max or Beast. I\\u2019ve also had fun adding classic lines like \\u2018I\\u2019m sorry, Priscilla. I\\u2019m afraid I can\\u2019t do that.\\u2019\\u201d But there are also some kinks to work out, particularly around voice commands. When Zuckerberg demonstrated the technology for a Fast Company story, he had to ask the robot to turn off the lights four times before it complied. Shutting down the music\\xa0took another two tries. (\\u201cWow, that\\u2019s like the most fails that it\\u2019s ever had,\\u201d the 32-year-old\\xa0told the reporter, visibly embarrassed.) Next up, Zuckerberg plans to create an Android app for the robot and connect it to more appliances around the house, such as his Big Green Egg grill. The ultimate challenge, he says, is \\u201cto build a system that could learn completely new skills on its own.\\u201d \\u201dIn the longer term, I\\u2019d like to explore teaching Jarvis how to learn new skills itself rather than me having to teach it how to perform specific tasks,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cIf I spent another year on this challenge, I\\u2019d focus more on learning how learning works.\\u201d Read more: Even Twitter\\u2019s \\u2018most powerful ambassador\\u2019 can\\u2019t pull it out of a slump Grandma\\u2019s favorite stocking stuffer is this year\\u2019s most surprising popular gift Donating $100M, Sandberg shows how women are leaning in after the election',\n",

And so here, the Sith lord telekinetically drives Krennic to his knees and gasping for air, lest the director not see the error of his ways.

Last month, temperatures in the high Arctic spiked dramatically, some\\xa036 degrees Fahrenheit above normal\\xa0\\u2014 a move that corresponded with record low levels of Arctic sea ice during a time of year when this ice is supposed to be expanding during the freezing polar night. And now this week, as you can see above, we\\u2019re seeing another huge burst of Arctic warmth. A buoy close to the North Pole\\xa0just reported\\xa0temperatures close to the freezing point of 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 Celsius), which is 10s of degrees warmer than normal for this time of year. Although it isn\\u2019t clear yet, we could now be in for another period when sea ice\\xa0either pauses its spread across the Arctic ocean, or reverses course entirely. But these bursts of Arctic warmth don\\u2019t stand alone \\u2014 last month, extremely warm North Pole temperatures corresponded with extremely cold temperatures over Siberia.\\xa0This week, meanwhile, there are large bursts of un-seasonally cold air over Alaska and Siberia once again. It is all looking rather consistent with an outlook that has been dubbed \\u201cWarm Arctic, Cold Continents\\u201d \\u2014 a notion that remains scientifically contentious but, if accurate, is deeply consequential for how climate change could unfold in the Northern Hemisphere winter. The core idea here begins with the\\xa0fact that the Arctic is warming up faster than the mid-latitudes and the equator, and losing its characteristic floating sea ice cover in the process. This also changes the Arctic atmosphere, the theory goes, and these changes interact with large scale atmospheric patterns that affect our weather (phenomena like the jet stream and the polar vortex). We won\\u2019t get into the details yet, but in essence, the result can be a kind of swapping of the cold air masses of the Arctic with the warm air masses to the south of them. The Arctic then gets hot (relatively), and the mid-latitudes \\u2014 including sometimes, as during the infamous \\u201cpolar vortex\\u201d event of 2013-2014, the United States \\u2014 get cold. Here\\u2019s an animation, provided by Jason Box of the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, of what this might look like. It shows that both during the November major Arctic warming event, and again this week, temperatures over the Arctic ocean spiked far\\xa0above their average, while temperatures over some high or mid-latitude land surfaces in the Northern Hemisphere fell well below average (the Arctic is at the far right):    Line plots showing average (near-surface air) temperature departures from normal, averaged around the world, across east-west belts (2.5 degrees latitude or ~250 km in width north-south) separately for land and ocean areas. (Jason Box)  The image, Box explained by email, \\u201cunderscores the distinction between ocean and land and thus points to there being something to the pattern\\u201d of \\u201cWarm Arctic, Cold Continents.\\u201d He continued: What are the impacts? Why should we care? For one, the patterns\\xa0indicate\\xa0a system changing state. For two: That change probably affects the frequency and persistence of weather, a hallmark of climate change; changing extremes\\u2026 more hots and ironically sometimes sharper colds. In recent years, several scientists have come up with different versions or incarnations of the \\u201cWarm Arctic, Cold Continents\\u201d idea. One of the best known is Rutgers University climate scientist and Arctic specialist Jennifer Francis, who published a\\xa02012 paper\\xa0with Stephen Vavrus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison arguing that the \\u201cArctic amplification\\u201d of global warming was leading to a more wavy and slower-moving jet stream, and this in turn was leading to extreme weather as different atmospheric patterns became stuck in place. Their paper highlighted not only changes in winter, but also throughout the year. \\u201cWhat I think we\\u2019ve been seeing this year has been totally consistent with the hypothesis that we\\u2019ve been working on,\\u201d Francis said in an interview of the recent Arctic drama. The jet stream is a global west-to-east flow (Francis often calls it a \\u201criver\\u201d) of air above our heads that carries with it weather we experience. But sometimes, the flow becomes quite elongated, looking much less like a tight loop around the planet and more like a series of slowly undulating waves. \\u201cWhat I think is happening is that it\\u2019s been very warm in the Arctic all year long and this has helped favor a very wavy jet stream, which is what we\\u2019ve been seeing,\\u201d she continued, \\u201cand that has helped to pump a lot of extra heat and moisture up into the Arctic.\\u201d   Visualization of a very wavy northern hemisphere jet stream. Credit: NASA  But then what about the cold continents? Judah Cohen,\\xa0the head of seasonal forecasting at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, said that this year in particular, low sea ice in the Arctic has led to a situation in which more snow falls over Siberia in the late fall, as Arctic moisture unlocked from the uncovered ocean gets pulled south over land and falls as snow. This doesn\\u2019t just make Siberia cold. Cohen believes it creates atmospheric reverberating effects that upset the polar vortex (the cold lower pressure region that normally hovers over the Arctic in winter), causing it to become elongated, migrate southward, and\\xa0allowing for the swapping of Arctic cold and mid-latitude warmth. \\u201cThis year, we had this unprecedented early polar votex weakening, polar vortex split, and that really kicked off this continental cooling we\\u2019ve seen this winter,\\u201d said Cohen. \\u201cIt started across Eurasia but obviously in December it\\u2019s come over North America as well, and so far there\\u2019s no signs of that going away.\\u201d But as Cohen acknowledges, \\u201cthe community is definitely polarized\\u201d over the validity of these ideas. \\u201cPeople are saying that [they] feel very strongly that any kind of cold that we\\u2019re seeing in the winter is just a product of natural variability, and there\\u2019s no forcing of it from the Arctic, let\\u2019s say. But I mean, I think every time you get a cold winter, that argument gets harder and harder to make.\\u201d Another\\xa0early theorist of the \\u201cWarm Arctic, Cold Continents\\u201d concept is James Overland, a researcher with the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who co-authored a\\xa0paper\\xa0on the topic in 2011, just after a record-breaking snowy Washington, D.C. winter in 2010. It concluded: Increased atmospheric temperatures over loss of sea ice areas, creates a meander in the polar vortex flow which will have different downstream effects in different years. Given a continuing trend for increased temperatures and thinner sea ice in the Arctic, modelling results and the data from recent late autumns, December 2008, 2009 and 2010, suggest that the frequency of an autumn warm Arctic\\u2014cold continents climate pattern will increase\\u2026. \\u201cThere are a lot of people in both camps,\\u201d Overland now says of the debate over these ideas. \\u201cIt\\u2019s fairly evenly matched.\\u201d But as he continues, referring to the present moment, \\u201cI think there\\u2019s a strong case to be made that we\\u2019re seeing the first real strong example of the loss of sea ice north of Alaska helping to lock in the longwave pattern and the cold temperatures on the East Coast.\\u201d (Francis, Cohen, and Overland were all co-authors of a\\xa02014 review paper\\xa0that looked at the evidence for whether the warming Arctic was indeed causing extreme weather effects in the mid-latitudes.) If these ideas are correct, they\\u2019re hugely important \\u2014 and not only because of the consequences for the weather we all experience in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. It\\u2019s also important because paradoxically, it could give momentum to climate change doubters, who will constantly be pointing to major snowstorms and cold temperatures where they live in order to cast doubt on the overall climate trend, even though it would be precisely that trend that is driving those select bouts of cold (even as the globe overall still shows a warming trend). Recently I checked in with one of the major skeptics of all of this \\u2014 National Center for Atmospheric Research climate scientist Kevin Trenberth, who has\\xa0debated Francis in the past, arguing that much of what she\\u2019s citing could be chalked up to natural climate variability and noting that climate change models don\\u2019t produce these effects. Trenberth didn\\u2019t deny that the fast-warming Arctic could have some ramifications outside of the Arctic. But he pointed out that the tropics of the Earth have a greater pull on weather overall and argued that processes happening in the Arctic winter aren\\u2019t that powerful, in the perspective of the globe as a whole. As he put it: What happens in the Arctic may not stay in the Arctic, but events there are always combined with other places: so in November the cold air formed but went over to Siberia.\\xa0More recently we had the cold outbreak in the US.\\xa0 It is not as if there is not cold air! These events are complicit and there is some randomness to them: we call it \\u201cweather.\\u201d In fact, in a sign of possible moderating of the debate, Francis said she agrees that \\u201cthe tropics rule the world,\\u201d and the Arctic is acting as more of a modulator. \\u201cWe\\u2019re saying that they do rule the world in a way but the Arctic can really change how their natural influence would typically happen. We\\u2019re seeing them intensify a pattern or maybe even reduce it.\\u201d For instance, tropical weather causes a major excursion of the jet stream northward, Arctic warming can then exacerbate that, she said. So for now, these ideas aren\\u2019t accepted by all of the relevant scientists \\u2013 but they definitely have a core group of supporters who are publishing, arguing, and citing recent events to advance their case. Scientists are gathering in Washington, D.C. in February to hash them out further \\u2013 by which time, we\\u2019ll know more about just how much winter weather itself has given momentum to the conversation. \\u201cWe continue to see this Arctic behaving so bizarrely, I think we\\u2019re in for a very interesting winter,\\u201d\\xa0said Francis.',\n",

One of them was Lydell Strickland, 27, who was sentenced to 155 years to life in prison. (Time Warner Cable News)   The crimes were so horrific that even a longtime\\xa0prosecutor choked on his words when he recalled what happened to the two victims. On the evening of Dec. 5, 2015, two 21-year-old male students from the University of Rochester were lured to a house several miles from campus, believing they were headed to a party. One of the\\xa0men\\xa0and a female acquaintance had been flirting on Facebook, and the young woman invited them to come hang out. Instead, the students walked into a trap. Moments after they arrived, the house went dark and a group of masked men pounced on them, bound them in duct tape and hauled them into a bathroom. There, over the next 40 hours, the attackers repeatedly tortured and sexually abused them, cutting them with knives and a chainsaw, dousing them in flammable liquids, and even shooting one in his legs. (The Post does not name victims of sexual abuse.) A police SWAT team stormed the house the following day and rescued the students, and eventually nine people were arrested and charged. Matthew Schwartz, one of the lead prosecutors in the case, would later say it was incredible that the students survived.

The torture that went on is almost indescribable.\\u201d On Wednesday, four people convicted in connection with the attack were sentenced in New York Supreme Court, among them the man who orchestrated the\\xa0students\\u2019 abduction and torture. Lydell Strickland, 27, was sentenced to 155 years to life in prison after being found guilty of more than two dozen charges, including kidnapping, assault, gang assault and sexual abuse, according to the Democrat and Chronicle. In court Wednesday, Strickland was defiant, smiling as Justice Alex Renzi told him his crimes sounded like the script of a Quentin Tarantino movie, the Democrat and Chronicle reported. \\u201cI was trying to think if there were any redeeming qualities that you had,\\u201d Renzi told him, \\u201cand I couldn\\u2019t come up with any.\\u201d \\u201cHow can someone do this to another human being?\\u201d he\\xa0added. Three of Strickland\\u2019s co-defendants were also sentenced for their roles in the case. David Alcaraz-Ubiles, convicted of kidnapping and weapons charges, received a 15-year prison sentence, which he will serve after he completes a 15-year sentence for an unrelated crime, the Democrat and Chronicle reported.\\xa0Inalia Rolldan and Ruth Lora were sentenced to seven years each following their convictions on kidnapping and weapons charges. They were at the house when the students were taken captive, but they did not participate in the torture, according to the Democrat and Chronicle. An attorney for Alcarez-Ubiles, 25, said his client did not assault the victims. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think there was anybody who disagreed with the fact that my client didn\\u2019t hit anybody, didn\\u2019t torture anybody, didn\\u2019t go into any of the rooms where the individuals were being held,\\u201d Frank Ciardi told TWC News.

Strickland\\u2019s attorney told TWC news he planned to appeal the sentence but did not elaborate. A defense attorney for Lora could not immediately be reached for comment but said during her trial last month that she had no role in the case other than a romantic interest in another suspect. Five other defendants have pleaded guilty to various roles in the attack. In November, four of them received sentences ranging from 13 to 35 years in prison, the Democrat and Chronicle reported. How the two students became the targets of\\xa0such a brutal crime remained a mystery until last fall when court documents and testimony revealed\\xa0the details of their ambush and torture. Strickland and his co-defendants mistakenly believed the students, who played on the university\\u2019s football team, were involved\\xa0in the robbery of a group of drug dealers in November 2015, prosecutors told the Tribune. Seeking retribution, the defendants convinced a woman to flirt with one of them on Facebook. The woman eventually invited him to a party in northeast Rochester, and he asked if he could bring the other, a friend. \\u201cThe second victim being involved was pure happenstance,\\u201d Schwartz told the Tribune. On Dec. 5, 2015, two women picked up the students and drove them to the house, where Strickland and others were waiting in masks and dark clothing. They surrounded the students, and one of them was shot in the leg with a .22-caliber rifle as he tried to escape, shattering his femur, prosecutors said. After binding the students with\\xa0duct tape, the group subjected them to a range of tortures over the course of nearly two days. One of the students described the ordeal from the witness stand in November. He and his friend were beaten with pipes and bats, threatened with guns, and even cut with a chainsaw, he said, and recounted how the attackers sliced the skin between his toes with a knife and pliers, according to TWC News. At one point he was shot in his other leg and later had to undergo surgery. He told the court the defendants doused them in flammable liquid and threatened to light them on fire. He said the defendants also stole thousands of dollars from his bank accounts after forcing him to give up his passwords and\\xa0identification numbers. \\u201cThe torture consists of something you would see in a movie, but it\\u2019s not a movie because this is real life,\\u201d he said, according to the Democrat and Chronicle. The whole time, he said, the defendants seemed almost giddy.\\xa0He recalled hearing from inside the bathroom men and women laughing and watching television. \\u201cThey were drinking and having a good time while there were people dying in the other room,\\u201d he testified. \\u201cAt this point, my body was broken down and I didn\\u2019t know how much longer I could go on.\\u201d Just before nightfall, after\\xa0being held captive for some 40 hours, the students heard explosions outside, according to the Democrat and Chronicle. A police SWAT team had come to save them. Their roommates had reported them missing, and an investigation led police to one of the women who lured them to the house, the Tribune reported. Neither of the victims appeared in court Wednesday. \\u201cThe victims wanted to begin to move on with their lives,\\u201d Schwartz, the prosecutor, told reporters after the sentences were handed down. \\u201cEvery time there\\u2019s another court appearance or proceeding,\\u201d he added, \\u201cit\\u2019s just a constant reminder of what took place last December.\\u201d More from Morning Mix \\u2018He died of a broken heart': Married 63 years, they died hours apart in same hospital room \\u2018I was astonished': French doctor discovers baby\\u2019s legs protruding from mother\\u2019s womb \\u2018Chilling': A serial animal killer may be on the loose in Canada, mutilating pets, wildlife\",\n",

Once laptop users install the newest operating system update -- macOS Sierra, which was released on Tuesday -- the estimate of how many hours and minutes are left in the\\xa0battery disappears\\xa0from the display in the menu bar. Instead the battery life indicator only shows the estimated percentage of battery life remaining. The software update is available on\\xa0Apple\\'s laptop and desktop computer devices. The update arrives on the heels of customer complaints about the battery life of the newest MacBook Pro model, with some Apple Support forum and Reddit users claiming that their laptops last from\\xa0about three to six hours,\\xa0a clear cutback from Apple\\'s promises of \\xa010-hour battery life. \\xa09to5Mac\\xa0reported on Tuesday that Apple investigated the matter and decided\\xa0that the issue wasn\\'t with the battery itself\\xa0but with the \"time remaining\" feature, which was often underreporting the amount of battery life left. And the company hasn\\'t amended its 10-hour battery promise. Battery-life claims, though,\\xa0are often based on a specific and optimized computer setup. 9to5Mac did some tests and came out with about an 8-hour battery performance\\xa0for the MacBook Pro. \"With macOS Sierra we have continued to advance our power management, and by design there is now an increased range between high performance and low-power states,\" Apple explained in a statement to Business Insider. \"When combined with the differing ways people use their Mac throughout the day, the calculation of remaining battery life displayed as a measure of time has become less accurate.\" Not everyone is\\xa0impressed by Apple\\'s response.\\xa0On Apple blog The Loop, Shawn King writes \"Apple taking the estimate away, even if wildly inaccurate, is silly.

       " 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/12/15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-iphones-first-super-mario-game/': (u'(Screen shots by Hayley Tsukayama)  Nintendo is really getting serious about its play for mobile screens, launching its first real smartphone game starring its most iconic character: Mario. The app, called Super Mario Run, hit Apple\\u2019s App Store on Thursday. For Nintendo fans everywhere, it\\u2019s the end of a long wait that started when the app was announced at Apple\\u2019s annual iPhone launch event in September. It\\u2019s also a key moment for\\xa0Nintendo, which has had a hard time dealing with the shift to casual gaming on smartphones and has resisted calls to put its classic characters into apps. Smartphones have introduced more people than ever to games \\u2014 as the Pok\\xe9mon Go craze illustrated \\u2014 but can also shift buyers away from game consoles and handheld devices such as Nintendo\\u2019s 3DS. By making a mobile game, Nintendo is saying that it\\u2019s finally ready to imagine an audience beyond its own hardware. So far, so good. Super Mario Run is a lot of fun. The designers have managed to make a game that blends nostalgia and the new technology of the touch screen well. The story, such as it is, is exactly the same \\u2014 Bowser has taken Princess Peach and you have to save her \\u2014 and you also must\\xa0rebuild your kingdom. The setting is familiar, and goombas and koopas are still trying to block your way to your goal. Longtime Nintendo fans with memories of gripping their Super Nintendo\\xa0controllers will see a lot they already love. But this time, they can play with one hand. This is not simply a classic Super Mario game transported to the iPhone. Some things have been streamlined for the touch screen. Super Mario Run is an endless running game, which means you\\u2019re almost always running forward. That could frustrate some players who might wonder why they\\xa0can\\u2019t move Mario all the ways they\\xa0could when he was an 8-bit sprite. You can\\u2019t go back and pick up coins you missed. You can\\u2019t take\\xa0little jaunts down the pipes. What you can do is jump. A lot. Tapping the screen will make Mario catch some air \\u2014 the longer you hold down your finger, the higher he goes before gravity kicks in. He can also vault off cliff edges and walls, which lets you reach higher places in the levels. Once you accept your perpetual forward motion, figuring out how to get where you want to go becomes a fun puzzle. Players will definitely get replay value out of the game, especially since it\\u2019s easy to run past things you might want to pick up. Going through a level again will let you go down roads not traveled before. Players also collect different-colored coins throughout the game, and the color and placement of those coins change as you meet your objectives. So\\xa0even if you play a level again, you should find something new. The coins feed your rebuilding efforts. Coins of different colors let you buy buildings and other swag to decorate and rebuild your kingdom. There\\u2019s also a second mode to the app, called Rally, which pits you against another real-world player and helps you win residents for your kingdom. You\\u2019re scored on how many normal coins you collect, as well as how much flair you exhibit while you\\u2019re racing. Over time, you can restore and repopulate your little patch of the world. The main drawback of Super Mario Run is that, in its free version, it\\u2019s very short. The free download gets you only three levels \\u2014 that doesn\\u2019t even get you to the first castle. The full version of the game costs $10. That price would probably feel right on an e-store for the 3DS or the Wii, and there is enough to do in the app to justify that price tag. But people who play games on smartphones have different expectations, and $10 is a lot to swallow when most other games are free or, at a stretch, $2. In some ways, the high app price could be seen as a signal that Nintendo, while definitely coming around on smartphones, still doesn\\u2019t get the platform \\u2014 or, at least, hasn\\u2019t fully given in to it. It is obvious that mobile games are going to be just a part of Nintendo\\u2019s future, since the firm is on the verge of introducing a new console called the Switch.\\xa0For most players, though, the high mobile price tag means they\\u2019ll get a taste of how fun Mario could be on the smartphone, but stop short of paying to see his full potential.',\n",

You will also see an alert if you\\'re about to share the news. (Facebook)   Facebook has struggled for months over whether it should crack down on false news stories and hoaxes\\xa0that are being spread on its site. Now, it has finally come to a decision. The social network is going to partner with the Poynter International Fact-Checking Network,\\xa0which includes groups\\xa0such as Snopes\\xa0and the Associated Press, to evaluate articles flagged by Facebook users. If those articles do not pass the smell test for the fact-checkers, Facebook will label that evaluation whenever they are posted or shared, along with a link to the organization that debunked the story. Many of the organizations said that they\\'re not getting paid for this. \\u201cWe have a responsibility to reduce the spread of fake news on our platform,\\u201d Adam Mosseri, Facebook vice president of product development, told The Washington Post. Mosseri said the social network still wants to be a place where\\xa0people with all kinds of opinions can express themselves\\xa0but has no interest in being the arbiter of what\\u2019s true and what\\'s not for its 1 billion users.   [Fake news on Facebook is a real problem. These college students came up with a fix in 36 hours.]    The new system will work like this: If a story on Facebook is patently false \\u2014 saying that a celebrity is dead when they are still alive, for example \\u2014 then users will see a notice that the story has been disputed or debunked. People who try to\\xa0share stories that have been found false will also see an alert before they post. Flagged stories will appear lower in the news feed than unflagged stories. Users will also be able to report potentially false stories to Facebook or send messages directly to the person posting a questionable article.    (Courtesy of Facebook)  The company is focusing, for now, on what Mosseri called the \\u201cbottom of the barrel\\u201d websites\\xa0that are purposefully set up to deceive and spread fake news, as well as those that are impersonating other news organizations. \\u201cWe are not looking to flag legitimate organizations,\\u201d Mosseri said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re looking for pages posing as legitimate organizations.\\u201d Articles from legitimate sites that are controversial or even wrong should not get flagged, he said.  There is no blacklist of sites that will automatically be labeled, Mosseri said. But Facebook has built a sort of data profile of characteristics that fake-news articles share \\u2014 such as low share numbers after the headline is clicked \\u2014 which it will use to decide when to have something fact-checked. The company will also prioritize checking stories that are getting lots of flags from users and are being shared widely, to go after the biggest targets possible.   [This is how Facebook\\u2019s fake-news writers make money]   If someone wants to appeal a label, they can direct that complaint to the fact-checking organization that made the call on whether an article was\\xa0false. It\\'s a little hard to evaluate how effective Facebook\\'s program might be, and whether the social network is doing enough to fight the fake news problem, said Duy Linh Tu, professor at the Columbia graduate school of journalism. \\u201cIf I\\u2019m a technology company, it seems like this is above and beyond...if the goal is providing your audience with the best content possible,\" he said.\\xa0\"From a journalistic side, is it enough? It\\u2019s a little late.\\u201d Plus, he said, Facebook is fine to filter out other content -- such as pornography -- for which the definition is unclear. There\\'s no clear explanation for why Facebook hasn\\'t decided to apply similar filters to fake news.\\xa0\\u201cI think that\\u2019s a little weak,\\u201d Tu said. \\u201cIf you recognize that it\\u2019s bad and journalists at the AP say it\\u2019s bad, you shouldn\\u2019t have it on your site.\\u201d Others said Facebook\\'s careful approach may be warranted. \"I think we\\'ll have to wait and see early results to determine how effective the strategy is,\" said Alexios Mantzarlis, of Poynter\\'s International Fact-Checking Network. \"In my eyes, erring on the side of caution is not a bad idea with something so complicated,\" he said. Facebook is also trying to crack down on people who have made a business in\\xa0fake news by tweaking\\xa0the social network\\'s advertising practices. Any article that has been disputed, for example, cannot be used in an ad. Facebook\\xa0is also playing around with ways to limit links from publishers with landing pages that are mostly ads \\u2014 a common tactic for fake-news websites.

Redstone will continue to hold the title \\u201cchairman emeritus,\\u201d but will participate in future board meetings of Viacom\\xa0in a nonvoting capacity,\\xa0according to a filing Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The change will take effect in February and was disclosed days after the Redstone family changed course\\xa0on a recommendation that CBS and Viacom combine into one company. Viacom controls a number of major brands, including MTV, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon; CBS is one of the country's largest television networks. The two split in 2006\\xa0in hopes that it would allow the firms to compete more nimbly in a changing media economy, but Viacom has lately struggled, with its stock price tumbling about 60 percent since 2014. While Redstone's daughter and Viacom's vice-chairman, Shari Redstone, had initially suggested the two media giants consider a merger \\u2014 a sign of her growing influence with her father\\xa0\\u2014 the\\xa0family later backtracked and recommended against the deal this month. In a letter on the matter,\\xa0Viacom and CBS's parent company \\u2014 which is privately held by the Redstone family \\u2014 cited recent leadership changes at Viacom for its change in thinking. The back-and-forth over CBS and Viacom's future was linked to a power struggle between Shari Redstone and two of Sumner Redstone's longtime business partners, Philippe Dauman and George Abrams, who in legal filings claimed Shari Redstone had manipulated her father into forcing them off Viacom's board. Stuart Slotnick, a defense attorney at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney PC who has worked with billionaires such as the casino magnate Steve Wynn, said the move will likely put to rest questions surrounding Redstone's ability to continue running his corporate empire. \\u201cThis move may be seen as a sign that Mr. Redstone\\u2019s daughter is confident that she is in a position of power and control,\\u201d he said. According to Friday's SEC filing, Shari Redstone will remain vice-chairman of Viacom, and the company's board will be trimmed from 15 positions to 10. Correction: A previous version misstated that Redstone was on Friday relinquishing his role as chairman. This version has been corrected.\",\n",

In a complaint that Change to Win said they filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Friday, the labor group claimed that T-Mobile sets \\u201cunrealistic sales targets\\u201d that encourage workers to act in ways that may not benefit consumers. The group found that some workers said they felt pressure to add insurance, phone lines and other services that customers didn\\u2019t explicitly ask for to meet sales targets and earn commission payments. The findings were based on a review of consumer complaints collected by the Federal Trade Commission, a consumer protection agency, interviews with workers and online surveys of people who identified themselves as T-Mobile employees and customers. \\u201cWe want T-Mobile to behave ethically and truly align customer service goals with consumers\\u2019 best interests,\\u201d said Matthew Painter, a spokesman for Change to Win. T-Mobile declined to comment on the report. Workers face daily pressure to produce sales, according to some employees interviewed by The Post. Progress may be tracked on a large board in a back room, where workers are ranked based on the number of activations, or new lines, they\\u2019ve sold, the employees said. People at the top of the list may have their numbers written in green and are rewarded with perks, such as being able to leave early or having first choice of days off, employees said. Employees with lagging sales numbers have their figures marked in red. Workers who don\\u2019t meet daily goals for some categories, such as accessories, may need to email their managers explaining why they were not able to sell enough accessories, said Jerrica Croxson, a retail sales associate for T-Mobile in San Antonio. Some T-Mobile employees told The Post that they are encouraged to present services and products as part of a \\u201cbundle,\\u201d by focusing on the total price and then listing the various items included. \\u201cWhen I tell you what the total is going to be, I\\u2019m supposed to include insurance,\\u201d Croxson said about the charge, which \\xa0can cost about $10 a month. \\u201cIt\\u2019s technically optional but I\\u2019m not supposed to present it as such.\\u201d One employee based in the Northeast who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her job said it took two weeks to figure out why her co-workers were meeting their sales targets while she was not: She alleged that many were knowingly presenting products vaguely to customers in hopes of getting them to agree to more expensive packages. When the customers complained about being charged for unwanted services, the employees would simply apologize, remove the offending product from the customer\\u2019s bill and issue a credit to the user\\u2019s account. Roughly one in three of the 2,200 self-identified T-Mobile customers surveyed by Change to Win claimed that the company enrolled them in services without their explicit consent. The unscientific poll questioned customers in five states \\u2014 Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Wisconsin. Consumer complaints collected by the Federal Trade Commission, a consumer protection agency, also reflect these experiences, though the agency did not verify them.  Still, many customers who were interviewed for this story said they had not experienced the problems identified by Change to Win. \\u201cThey\\u2019ve always been super clear when I\\u2019ve called and asked about anything,\\u201d said Emil Caillaux, who has had his T-Mobile plan since 2008. \\u201cI\\u2019ve actually been very happy with how transparent they\\u2019ve been.\\u201d The report comes weeks after the CFPB warned financial companies in the wake of the Wells Fargo scandal to avoid sales incentives that can lead to unauthorized accounts or to overcharging consumers. The warning is what prompted Change to Win to file to the agency. Before that, T-Mobile and AT&T agreed to settlements of $90 million and $105 million respectively in 2014 for \\u201ccramming\\u201d millions of customers with unwanted charges on their accounts. Federal and state regulators said the companies charged customers $9.99 a month for ringtones, wallpaper, horoscopes and other services they never requested. \\u201cPhone bills are an easy place to extract phony charges [from customers] because they are generally very difficult to read, and many of these charges are masked,\\u201d said David Vladeck, a Georgetown University law professor and former head of the FTC\\u2019s consumer protection bureau. The FTC declined to comment on whether it was investigating T-Mobile for the sales practices highlighted by the labor group.

(Kim Jin-a/Newsis via AP)  Consumer advocates have filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission charging that Google violated user privacy through a policy change\\xa0that gives the company more leeway to build profiles of people as they browse the Web and use Google services. The complaint, submitted Thursday by Consumer Watchdog and the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, alleges that Google acted in a \\u201chighly deceptive manner\\u201d in changing its privacy policy in June to allow the merging of data collected by various services owned by the company, such as Google Maps, Google search and the DoubleClick online advertising service. The result, the groups say, allows for the gathering of more comprehensive information on most people who use the Web. The changes, which were activated if users opted in when prompted by a query, were widely covered by tech-oriented news sites at the time. Google disputes the allegation that the company acted deceptively and said it made the changes only after testing among users around the world.   [Googling yourself will soon bring a new surprise]   But the consumer advocates contend that Google did a poor job explaining the changes to its users, causing many to accept changes that undermined their personal privacy without understanding the consequences. \\u201cGoogle indeed has been a serial privacy violator,\\u201d said John M. Simpson, privacy project director for Consumer Watchdog. \\u201cSomething needs to be done that gets their attention.\\u201d The issue is sensitive because of Google\\u2019s history of privacy controversies, one of which resulted in a consent decree with the FTC in 2011 requiring 20 years of audits and promises to not misrepresent privacy policy changes in the future. That decree resulted from Google's handling of user data when it started its ill-fated \\u201cGoogle Buzz\\u201d social network.   [Pok\\xe9mon Go had \\u2018full access\\u2019 to the Google accounts of some iPhone players]   The consumer advocates say the June changes violated that consent decree and that the company should be forced to relinquish the advertising revenue collected since then \\u2014 an amount that Simpson said could reach into the billions of dollars. The company agreed\\xa0to a record FTC fine of $22.5 million\\xa0in 2012 after allegations that the company worked around privacy settings on Apple's Safari browser to track users. Google's June changes to its privacy policy drew scrutiny in October, when a report in ProPublica described the shifts as backtracking on a practice, dating to Google's purchase of DoubleClick in 2007, of keeping the advertising network\\u2019s data separate from the information collected for other Google products. The June changes, ProPublica wrote, \\u201cquietly erased that last privacy line in the sand \\u2014 literally crossing out the lines in its privacy policy that promised to keep the two pots of data separate by default.\\u201d   [How to make Google forget your most embarrassing searches]   Google has portrayed the privacy policy changes as a natural evolution as users access various company services across a variety of devices, and the company said it worked hard to make sure that users understood the changes and how to manage the privacy settings on their accounts. \\u201cThis past June we updated our ads system, and the associated user controls, to match the way people use Google today: across many different devices,\\u201d the company said in a statement to The Washington Post that echoed the statement to ProPublica in October. \\u201cBefore we launched this update, we tested it around the world with the goal of understanding how to provide users with clear choice and transparency. As a result, it is 100 percent optional \\u2014 if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged.\\u201d Government scrutiny in the United States, Europe and beyond has become\\xa0a recurring issue for Google as it has grown into one of the world\\u2019s most profitable and pervasive companies.

The early success of \\u201cRogue One\\u201d \\u2014 which details how the Rebel Alliance obtained the plans to defeat the Death Star in \\u201cA New Hope\\u201d \\u2014 suggests audiences are more than willing to explore beyond the traditional Skywalker narrative that\\'s dominated the series since its first release in 1977. Now, Disney faces an even greater challenge: developing Star Wars at a pace that won\\'t exhaust audiences, or the source material, too quickly as\\xa0executives seek to grow\\xa0the sci-fi franchise into the size of a small moon. Under Disney\\'s stewardship, Star Wars is\\xa0already being compared to the Marvel universe, a sprawling media empire also owned by Disney that has contributed to\\xa0what some experts call \\u201csuperhero fatigue.\\u201d Although superhero movies still make loads of money, a persistent critique of the genre is their formulaic homogeneity and a relentless firehose of content. And it\\'s a trap that Star Wars would do well to avoid. Marvel has won\\xa0plaudits for weaving an interlocking web of comic books, TV shows and movies that allows for endless spinoffs, sequels, prequels and reboots.\\xa0Fans of \\u201cThe Avengers,\\u201d for example, have gotten\\xa0separate movies and shows about individual Marvel characters (\\u201cIron Man,\\u201d \\u201cCaptain America\\u201d) or\\xa0institutions (ABC\\'s \\u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\"). It\\'s all part of a bigger strategy at Marvel to grow the fan base while also appealing to longtime loyalists. In June, Marvel Editor in Chief Axel Alonso told Entertainment Weekly\\xa0that his goal is to build a wealth of\\xa0\\u201cdiverse, exciting and accessible entry points into our world.\\u201d But the proliferation of those entry points has some fans growing tired of superhero films. The\\xa0complaints range from\\xa0one-dimensional\\xa0villains to heavily digitized fight scenes to an overreliance on magic objects as plot devices, adding up to a cookie-cutter approach to moviemaking. Even comedian John Oliver has piled on. Analysts say there\\'s a good reason\\xa0large media franchises suffer from these problems. \\u201cWhen you\\'re making\\xa0$100 million bets [as a studio], you need to make every decision with risk aversion in mind,\\u201d said Laura Martin, a Disney analyst at Needham & Co. \\u201cWhat works before is likely to work again.\\u201d With \\u201cRogue One\\u201d as a tail wind, Disney can plow ahead with its as-yet unnamed\\xa0spinoff\\xa0introducing\\xa0fans new and old to a young Han Solo. But as the custodian of George Lucas\\'s beloved creation,\\xa0Disney may have to confront with Star Wars some of the same pitfalls that critics say\\xa0have weakened the superhero-industrial complex. Box-office numbers show that superhero films continue to impress. Roughly half of\\xa0films released in the genre between 2008 and 2015\\xa0ended up ranking in the annual top-10 lists for highest-grossing movies, according to comScore. Still, just because a film performs well financially doesn\\'t mean it is a quality movie, critics say. In 2014, the Los Angeles Times called \\u201cCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\\u201d a capable action flick that lacked inspiration, but it did nearly $100 million in box-office sales its opening weekend. \\u201cIt\\'s a product of the highest quality, but at the end of the day that\\'s what it is: a machine-made, assembly-line product whose strengths tend to feel like items checked off a master list rather than being the result of any kind of individual creative touch,\\u201d wrote film critic Kenneth Turan. The roteness, some say, has even infected the musical scores of many superhero films, in which filmmakers opt for forgettable placeholder tunes rather than distinctive, creative\\xa0motifs. \\u201cWith every new cycle of deafening promotion, \\'there sure are a lot of superhero movies, and it\\'s getting to be too much\\' inches closer to objective, uncontroversial truth,\\u201d wrote Rolling Stone in June. To its credit, \\u201cRogue One\\u201d largely escapes these traps. And Star Wars under Disney may prove to be more complex than the standard superhero fare, which could help inoculate the sci-fi franchise from\\xa0staleness. For example, while Lucas\\'s initial\\xa0trilogy dovetails with familiar superhero tropes \\u2014 a young boy comes of age amid loss and the discovery of seemingly supernatural powers in an epic battle between good and evil \\u2014 \\u201cRogue One\\u201d seems\\xa0open to challenging the previously unquestioned moral frame of the Star Wars universe. The Rebel forces are not universally united nor unimpeachable, and some Imperial agents are portrayed as victims of circumstance and\\xa0perhaps even deserve our sympathy. Looking at the galaxy as a place of nuance and ambiguity affords Disney some greater storytelling perspectives and, ultimately, a more interesting universe to explore. But even if there may be more room for Star Wars to maneuver, it is still at risk of getting stuck in its own trench run. Many critics soured on \\u201cThe Force Awakens\\u201d for resorting to a tired major plot device; by virtue of the story\\xa0at play, \\u201cRogue One\\u201d was no different, with its all-encompassing obsession with a certain Imperial megaweapon. The\\xa0challenge for Disney is threefold. It must introduce new plotlines\\xa0that extend the Star Wars universe beyond the aging, traditional cast of characters. It must offer a steady drip of fresh material without turning away new audiences that may feel overwhelmed at the prospect of catching up. And it must stay true to legacy fans who view Disney as the responsible steward of one of the world\\'s most beloved film franchises. May the Force be with it.',\n",

It has gotten so bad that the public defender's office filed a motion last month\\xa0for the county court\\xa0to immediately fix\\xa0the problems caused by the county court's software system, called Odyssey Case Manager, or scrap\\xa0the system completely. A total of 26 separate incidents\\xa0were\\xa0documented in the motion, though Public Defender Brendon Woods\\xa0stressed that this was\\xa0\\u201cjust the tip of the iceberg\\u201d in terms of the number of people affected. \\u201cPeople\\u2019s lives are being drastically changed. This is something that needs to be fixed immediately and not later,\\u201d Woods said to The Washington Post. Odyssey\\xa0manages a court's logistics, keeping track of people who have entered the legal system and the status of their cases.\\xa0It's employed across 600 counties in 21 different states, serving\\xa0an estimated one-third of all courts in the country, according to the company behind the software, Tyler Technologies. For many courts, the digital record keeper is a welcome upgrade from aging computer systems and\\xa0paper files, and its popularity is an apparent testament to its workability. But when installed in Alameda County in August,\\xa0Woods said,\\xa0the new software caused a domino-like series of problems\\xa0on the court's digital\\xa0filings. As Woods described it, the biggest\\xa0issue\\xa0for the county stems from the user interface. Using Odyssey, he said, clerks\\xa0typically\\xa0take\\xa020 to 30 minutes to input all of the data needed to file a court action, such as an issued warrant or jail release. The old system took just\\xa0two to three\\xa0minutes per case. It has caused a backup in which\\xa0cases\\xa0aren't\\xa0updated on\\xa0time, causing, for example, a defendant\\xa0who had already shown up for his court date to be arrested again because his\\xa0case file showed\\xa0outdated information.\\xa0Incomplete filings are growing\\xa0by an estimated 200 to 300 a day, according to\\xa0Woods. Woods also said Odyssey's data is\\xa0not interacting correctly with other legal software\\xa0in the system. People who have been charged with drug offenses are showing up as sex offenders, Woods used as\\xa0an example. And some\\xa0cases already settled in the old system have shown up in the new system incorrectly. \\u201cThere are just so many levels to this problem it's hard to even quantify,\\u201d Woods said. \\u201cBut it's not a person\\u2019s fault. It\\u2019s a software problem.\\u201d Odyssey's problems haven't been limited to Alameda County.\\xa0In\\xa0Shelby County, Tenn., which also implemented Odyssey recently, a group of defendants filed a class action lawsuit against the sheriff alleging that they were held in jail past their release dates during a computer software upgrade, according to the Memphis Daily News. While county commissioners, who blamed Odyssey, at one point considered pursuing a\\xa0lawsuit against Tyler Technologies, the Memphis Daily News reported, the idea has been dropped. County commissioners say that they realized that delays were caused\\xa0by\\xa0integration of the new software into several existing systems\\xa0rather than glitches\\xa0or bugs with Odyssey itself. Two years ago in Marion County, Ind., a lawsuit was filed against the county jail by two inmates who claim that because of issues with the newly installed Odyssey software, they were held in jail for days after they were supposed to be released, according to the Indianapolis Star. The Marion County Sheriff's Office declined to comment on the pending case. Asked about the three counties' complaints,\\xa0Jeff Puckett, the president of Tyler Technologies's courts and justice division, said that in each of these cases, issues\\xa0stemmed from\\xa0different circumstances involving \\u201cfine-tuning\\u201d the software implementation and interaction with existing systems. \\u201cThis is not a new piece of software,\\u201d he said, adding that Tyler\\xa0has not been contacted by any of the three court systems about actual bugs or glitches. \\u201cTo draw a line from these problems to, 'Well, the software is broken or is not doing its job,' is just not a fair conclusion.\\u201d When pressed about whether Tyler could\\xa0provide better integration support to courts that use its software, Puckett said the question was asked under a \\u201cfalse premise.\\u201d \\u201cTyler's responsibility is limited to implementing the Odyssey courts system,\\u201d he said. He added that the company has a\\xa0support staff devoted to transitioning clients to use of their software. But for public defender Woods, it's less about who is to blame and more about\\xa0doing something to stop the problem. The county court has set a date in January to hear the public defender's motion, which Woods says is simply too far away. Last week, the defender's office filed a writ to an appellate court to grant their request to be heard before the January date. \\u201cTo anyone who says it's just a few issues, I\\xa0want them to come down and talk to the person who served 14 extra days illegally, tell them it's just a small crack in the system. Talk to my client who was jailed in front of their parent's house,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey can\\u2019t quantify the human experience by saying it's a small number of cases,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeople are suffering.\\u201d\",\n",

(Melissa Lyttle for The Washington Post)  In June, a gunman\\xa0killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a horrific spate of violence at a gay nightclub in Orlando. Now, the families of some of the victims are suing Google, Twitter and Facebook, arguing that the tech companies had a\\xa0role in the shooter's radicalization. The families are accusing the companies of providing support to\\xa0the Islamic State, the terrorist organization that\\xa0appeared to inspire the attack. Although the gunman, Omar Mateen, did not appear to have official ties to the Islamic State, also referred to as ISIS, the victims' families say the group's indirect influence over the gunman is at least partly\\xa0attributable to its\\xa0\\u201cunfettered\\u201d ability to recruit fighters on social media. Through their data-driven business models, companies such as Google, Twitter and Facebook even \\u201cprofit from ISIS postings through advertising revenue,\\u201d according to the lawsuit,\\xa0which was filed in a Michigan federal court Monday and was first reported by Fox News. The families of\\xa0Tevin Eugene Crosby, Juan Guerrero and Javier Jorge-Reyes are demanding a trial and unspecified monetary compensation. \\u201cWithout \\u2026 Twitter, Facebook, and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,\\u201d the lawsuit reads. The suit is not the first to target tech companies over ISIS's influence. In a pair of separate court proceedings\\xa0earlier this year, the families of people killed in the 2015 Paris attacks and in an incident in Jordan accused Twitter of providing material support to the terrorist group.\\xa0In both cases, Twitter argued that it could not be sued because it was simply acting as a conduit for online speech, rather than a speaker for ISIS itself. The judge in the case about the Jordanian incident appeared to side with Twitter, dismissing the suit and saying that\\xa0Twitter is protected by the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The other case, which also names Google and Facebook, is pending. (Both were filed in\\xa0California.) Section 230 of the act shields \\u201conline intermediaries that host or republish speech \\u2026 against a range of laws that might otherwise be used to hold them legally responsible for what others say and do,\\u201d according to the\\xa0Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights organization. The result, according to EFF, has been the flourishing of an Internet economy that includes Yelp, YouTube and Amazon \\u2014\\xa0where individual users are held responsible for their own conduct on the platforms. A lawyer representing the Orlando shooting victims' families said that Monday's filing contains a new claim that no lawsuit has tried before. It alleges that tech companies\\xa0create new content that does not enjoy the protections of Section 230 when they marry advertising with an ISIS supporter's online posts.\\xa0\\u201cWhile they didn't create the ad, and they didn't create the posting, by putting those\\xa0things together, they created specific unique content,\\u201d said Keith Altman, an attorney at Excolo Law. It's unclear whether this argument will fare any better than the earlier ones. Courts have traditionally held that online platforms are not legally liable for the content they host, according to ISIS experts. It's \\u201cin the same way that a telephone company is not responsible if you use your phone to hire a contract killer,\\u201d said J.M. Berger,\\xa0a fellow with the International Center for Counter-Terrorism. \\u201cIt's very unlikely that this kind of lawsuit will succeed under current laws.\\u201d But, Berger added, Congress could seek to change those laws if it saw fit.\\xa0\\u201cIn our brave new world starting January, who knows?\\u201d he said. Further lawsuits accusing social media platforms of promoting ISIS may naturally peter out if judges continue to invoke the Communications Decency Act, according to a spokesperson for one of the tech companies named in Monday's suit. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing legal proceedings. \\u201cThese types of cases are always going to get press coverage,\\u201d the person said. \\u201cBut I think there will be certain diminishing returns this time, because this is at least the third case like this, and the first two aren't going anywhere.\\u201d Facebook said in a statement that it is committed to providing a safe experience for its users.\\xa0\\u201cOur Community Standards make clear that there is no place on Facebook for groups that engage in terrorist activity,\\u201d the company said, \\u201cor for content that expresses support for such activity, and we take swift action to remove this content when it\\u2019s reported to us. We sympathize with the victims and their families.\\u201d The other company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\",\n",

(Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)  \\xa0 Separate groups of the world\\u2019s leading technology companies are launching two initiatives to curb \\u201cthe worst forms of child labor\\u201d and other abusive practices in the supply chain for cobalt, a key ingredient in lithium-ion batteries that power smartphones, laptops and electric cars. About 60 percent of the world\\u2019s cobalt originates in the Congo, where hand-dug mines rife with dangers attract legions of poorly equipped \\u201cartisanal\\u201d miners who work for as little as $2 a day. Apple, HP, Samsung SDI and Sony have joined an effort known as the Responsible Cobalt Initiative. It is being led by a Chinese business group, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce for Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters, and supported by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), according to the Chinese group. Members of the initiative pledged to follow OECD guidelines for mining supply chains, which call for companies to trace how cobalt is being extracted, transported, manufactured and sold. Any abuses would require immediate correction. Advocacy groups have alleged for years that cobalt was posing deadly risks to miners and causing environmental damage, but eradicating the worst abuses has proved difficult because tracing cobalt in consumer products back to the mines involves global leaps \\u2014 from Africa to China to world markets \\u2014 and across many companies. \\xa0 The Washington Post earlier this year published an investigation detailing abuses in Congo\\u2019s artisanal cobalt supply chain, showing how miners \\u2014 including children \\u2014 worked in dangerous, at times deadly conditions as they tunneled hundreds of feet underground for dollars a day to reach the precious mineral. The article also showed the potential health effects, including birth defects, that medical researchers have begun to connect to the mining activity. The Post for the first time connected this troubling artisanal cobalt trade with the batteries used by some of the world\\u2019s largest technology companies, including Apple.   [Cobalt mining for lithium-ion batteries has a high human cost]   Apple acknowledged that this cobalt has made its way into some of its batteries and said it was committed to working with its supplier to address underlying issues, such as extreme poverty, that result in harsh work conditions and child labor. The role of the Chinese business organization in the new initiative is considered a key advantage \\u2014 the bulk of the supply chain runs through that country. Several companies with key roles in refining and packaging the mineral for batteries have joined the initiative, including Zhejiang Huayou, a Chinese company that buys cobalt from Congo miners and was featured in The Post\\u2019s coverage. \\u201cThe problem cannot be fixed by one company,\\u201d said Bryce Lee, Huayou\\u2019s new manager for responsible sourcing. \"So I think it\\u2019s great, surprising even, that so many companies have come together.\" The new initiative is \\u201ca very positive sign of change, \\u201d said Tyler Gillard, project head for the OECD. \\u201cSuch strong involvement of Chinese industry in particular is uncommon for these types of initiatives and really exciting.\\u201d Collectively, the group is aiming to promote cooperation with the government of the Congo. Separately, a business group known as the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition has announced the\\xa0new \\u201cResponsible Raw Materials Initiative.\\u201d The EICC\\xa0said companies need to expand scrutiny of their supply chains beyond the traditional four \\u201cconflict\\u201d minerals covered by U.S. legislation \\u2014 tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold. These minerals, when taken from the Congo region, receive extra attention because of potential ties to funding militias. The EICC said the decision to begin looking at other minerals was motivated by \\u201ca growing body of research\\u201d \\u2014 including work by advocacy groups and The Post \\u2014 that showed abuses occurred in the production of these other minerals, too. Bob Mitchell, EICC vice president for social and environmental responsibility, said one of the minerals the initiative is considering is cobalt from Congo. The EICC announced its initiative last month, just before the start of a U.N.\\xa0forum on business and human rights. Membership in the EICC includes Apple, Dell, Foxconn, Ford Motors and other companies, and 19 EICC-member companies have signed pledges to support the new initiative, Mitchell said. Exactly what to do about the artisanal mining of cobalt is a matter of heated debate. The practice is rife with dangers. On the other hand, it also helps desperately poor people make a living, particularly in the rural areas of\\xa0Congo. Some long-standing critics of the cobalt supply chain view the Responsible Cobalt Initiative merely as a good first step. \\u201cImplementation is obviously what it\\u2019s all about,\\u201d said Mark Dummett, an Amnesty International researcher who has studied cobalt supply chains. \\u201cWe\\u2019d now like to see the downstream companies like Apple and Samsung disclose the names of their cobalt smelters as well as disclose the risks they have identified in their supply chains.\\u201d Companies said a collective effort such as this is required to eradicate any abuses in the cobalt supply chain. \\u201cHP recognizes that in order to build leverage over supply chain actors that we do not have a direct business relationship with, we need to work with other companies and organizations to drive collective action,\\u201d Jay Celorie, HP\\'s global program manager for human rights, ethics and compliance, said in a statement. Other companies, such as Tesla and LG Chem, said they are weighing membership in the Responsible Cobalt Initiative or undertaking other ways of ensuring that their supply chains are clean and humane. \\u201cWe are evaluating a number of new international initiatives to address the issues in cobalt production and are working quickly to determine how Tesla can be most effectively involved,\\u201d Tesla said in a statement. Other industry groups are responding to complaints about the cobalt supply chain, too. Last week, Umicore, a large Brussels-based maker of battery parts and other cobalt products, announced that the auditing firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers had validated the safeguards it has in place to prevent the use of any cobalt arising from questionable environmental or labor practices. Among other things, the company seeks to be able to trace the origins of every bit of cobalt that goes in its products. Umicore officials said that seeking the third-party validation of their cobalt procedures should ease the concerns of the consumer companies that are their customers. \\u201cOur customers have valuable brands to protect,\\u201d said Marc Van Sande, executive vice president of a company business unit. This approach \\u201cprovides comfort to customers about the provenance and the ethical nature of the cobalt used in the materials they source.\\u201d Related stories: The batteries in your favorite devices are literally covering Chinese villages in black soot Indigenous people are left poor as tech world takes lithium from under their feet    ',\n",

Tongo)  As rumors swirl about Verizon\\'s plans for acquiring Yahoo, business analysts say the former search giant could see choppier waters ahead if Verizon backs out of the deal, as some observers have suggested it should do. Yahoo, the\\xa0troubled Internet company that once dominated the online search market, last week disclosed a massive data breach that occurred in 2013 and affected up to a billion users. The admission came just weeks after another announcement that hackers had put\\xa0half a million Yahoo accounts at risk sometime in 2014. Together, they rank as the two biggest known hackings in corporate history. Verizon\\xa0expressed significant concerns over the smaller breach in October, signaling that it could jeopardize its $4.8 billion bid for Yahoo. Executives at the telecom behemoth said they were leaning toward concluding that the hack had adversely affected Yahoo\\'s core business, making it a less attractive purchase.   [It took three years for Yahoo to tell us about its latest breach. Why does it take so long?]   The initial hack could have been written off as a one-time event, analysts say, but\\xa0the\\xa0bigger breach will be impossible to ignore. For Verizon, the stakes\\xa0have risen. Although it has not raised fresh warning flags over the new disclosure, the telecom firm must balance Yahoo\\'s initial estimated value against the possibility of discovering even more hackings down the road. \"It\\u2019s like buying a ticking time bomb,\"said Jeff Kagan, an independent industry analyst. \"You never know when it\\u2019s going to blow again, and could keep blowing up time after time.\" Security experts have criticized Yahoo\\'s use of outdated\\xa0security technologies\\xa0to defend user data, and the\\xa0company\\'s top security official resigned in protest\\xa0in 2015 when he was cut out of a major decision to allow the federal government to scan customer emails. The renewed concerns over Yahoo have\\xa0caused Verizon to think seriously about abandoning the deal or asking for a discount, Bloomberg News\\xa0reported Friday. Some analysts have suggested that Verizon may seek as much as a $200 million price cut.   [Yahoo says 1 billion user accounts were hacked]   Backing out of the deal, Kagan said, probably would cause Yahoo\\'s value to decline. But Verizon is more\\xa0likely to seek a discount than to walk away, according to a mergers and acquisitions lawyer familiar with the transaction who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss matters of corporate strategy. A discount could help offset the potential legal, regulatory or reputational risks that Verizon may assume by going\\xa0through with the deal, according to analysts.\\xa0By just how much is unclear.\\xa0\"As we\\'ve said all along, we will evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation,\" Verizon said in a statement last week. The company declined to comment for this story. Yahoo executives say the core business remains strong. Chief executive Marissa Mayer told investors on a recent earnings call that the company had \"launched several new products and showed solid financial performance across the board.\" Yahoo said Tuesday in a statement that it is confident in its value and that \"we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.\" But should that effort collapse, the consequences for Yahoo could be dire, according to analysts who say the company has been losing staff at an alarming rate. \"Yahoo has no Plan B,\" said Laura Martin, an industry analyst at Needham & Co. \"People have been leaving in droves,\" creating gaps in talent that could be difficult to fill if Verizon backed out of the transaction. The result, she said, may be a less\\xa0healthy organization at a time when it most needs to show that it is fully functional.',\n",

(iStock)  Today is the last cutoff for the U.S. Postal Service's holiday shipping. But if you're still stumped about someone's gift (or if their name slipped your mind and your list), all is not lost. One of the best things about the Internet is that it transcends the physical \\u2014 though not the commercial \\u2014 bonds of the holiday season. But just because a gift is electronic, or last-minute, doesn't always make it less thoughtful. There are plenty of ways to buy good gifts that will deliver instantly.\\xa0Plus, you get to save on gift wrap. Here are some suggestions: Subscription boxes\\xa0\\u2014 You could rush to send one present now, or take a deep breath and send three, six or 12\\xa0throughout the year. Subscription boxes, which give their recipients mystery packages based on a theme, can now be found for almost any interest.\\xa0Whether you're looking for a gift for someone who wants to spice up their wardrobe or spice up their diet, there's a box out to fit their tastes. Try browsing through Cratejoy or Quarterly for suggestions for a variety of boxes, or maybe just run an online search for \\u201c[your interest here] subscription box\\u201d and see what turns up. Experiences \\u2014\\xa0Buying experiences \\u2014 a hot-air balloon ride, a semester of art classes, a night at the theater, a wine-tasting \\u2014 has a couple of advantages. For one, they have to be thoughtful, so even if you only thought of someone at the last minute, it really won't seem like a rush job. Two, an experience is not a gift you can really wrap anyway, so there's no shame in sending it electronically. You can scour sites such as Groupon for prepackaged ideas or just run a search for your recipient's interests in their hometown and see where it takes you. Or fashion one of your own by looking for local businesses such as vineyards, community classes, art stores, spas, cooking stores, athletic groups and food tours with websites that will let you book these types of experiences for someone else. Picking\\xa0multiple activities can be a nice way to keep the present going throughout the year. E-books \\u2014\\xa0Books are always popular gifts for the holidays, so why not try their electronic versions? It may not have the heft of a well-wrapped book, but it does have advantages. E-book prices tend to be a little cheaper than hardcovers, so you can buy a whole shelf's worth of books for the reader in your life. Not to mention, it saves a lot of room for travelers who probably aren't looking to pack a library. You can give e-books in a lot of ways. Amazon's Kindle lets you send e-books from a book's product page. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) You can also give titles via iBooks\\xa0by hitting\\xa0the \\u201cgift\\u201d option in the share menu from the iBooks app. Or you can go\\xa0through Google Play with a general gift card to Google's app store. If books aren't quite right, you could consider giving a subscription to a magazine or newspaper,\\xa0or try an audiobook subscription from a company such as Amazon's Audible. Streaming video subscriptions \\u2014\\xa0Everyone likes to veg out now and then. And the gift of a streaming video service, such as Hulu or Netflix, gives your loved ones a license to chill. The giving process for some of these subscriptions has become a little more complicated of late, as\\xa0neither Netflix nor Hulu offers gift codes from their own sites anymore. However, many retailers \\u2014 including Walmart, Amazon and Newegg \\u2014 will let you purchase subscription gift cards and deliver them electronically. If you're looking for something a little more specialized, check for niche streaming services that serve your needs. Acorn TV, for example, could be good for the Anglophile in your life. Or try Crunchyroll for anime fans. Horror fans may want to sink their teeth into Shudder, AMC's horror-only streaming site. There's even a streaming site just for Broadway shows. Or, if your intended gift recipient can't get enough of a particular channel \\u2014 HBO, Showtime, etc. \\u2014 see if there is a streaming service just for that channel's shows. Streaming music subscriptions \\u2014\\xa0Music service subscriptions are another good option for a digital gift, particularly if you never quite understood your Uncle Harold's music taste to begin with. Buy a new subscription or, if your intended recipient already uses a\\xa0music service \\u2014 such as Pandora, Spotify, iTunes, etc. \\u2014 you can buy a premium subscription. In the case of Apple Music or Google Play Music (which will also get them access to YouTube's premium service, YouTube Red), you can buy a gift card through the appropriate app store. Donations \\u2014\\xa0Some giftees may prefer material presents. But for those who really do seem to have everything or those who wear their hearts on their sleeves, matching the right recipient to the right charity can be gifting gold. That may be especially relevant during a political year, when big issues\\xa0beg our attention. Most charities will take online donations and often make it very easy to give in someone else's name.\\xa0Be sure to include\\xa0a thoughtful note explaining why you wanted to contribute in the name of the person on your list. Games \\u2014\\xa0If you have a gamer in your life, it's pretty easy to give the joy of video games online \\u2014 which is how more than 50 percent of sales\\xa0are going. You can buy gift cards for the PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo online stores by heading to their websites. If the person on your list is more of a PC fan, there's always the Steam platform, or you can buy cards for individual publishers (like Electronic Arts) or individual games, such as League of Legends, through retailers. All in all, digital gifts can be just as touching and lovely as any beautifully wrapped present.\\xa0Though, if you're still feeling guilty, you can always include a homemade cookie or other tasty treat to go along with your gift.\",\n",

The attention from State comes as industry groups have recently launched two initiatives aimed at curbing child labor and other dangerous practices in their cobalt supply chains. Cobalt is essential for the lithium-ion batteries used in smartphones, laptops and electric vehicles. Sixty percent of the world\\u2019s supply of cobalt comes from Congo, which has a long history of loose regulation of mines. Now, the State Department sees a rare opportunity to tackle this long-standing problem \\u201cin light of the stories that have come out and the greater concern that companies have exhibited,\\u201d said the government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \\u201cYou have the beginnings of something that can bring about long-lasting change,\\u201d the official said. The Washington Post this year published an investigation detailing abuses in Congo\\u2019s artisanal cobalt supply chain, showing how miners \\u2014 including children \\u2014 labor in hazardous, even deadly, conditions as they dig hundreds of feet underground. The Post connected this troubling artisanal cobalt trade with the batteries used by some of the world\\u2019s largest technology companies, including Apple. Despite years of allegations from advocacy groups that cobalt mining posed a deadly risk and employed child workers, solving the problem has proved difficult. The State Department tracks human rights problems worldwide, and its Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor for years has noted that children work in Congo\\'s mining industry. The United States currently regulates the trade of four \"conflict minerals\" from the Congo region. A 2010 law aimed at stemming the flow of money to Congo\\'s murderous militias requires U.S. companies to attempt to trace the sources of their tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold. The same diligence is not required with cobalt. While the cobalt trade is not thought to be funding wars, the trade is marred by many of the same abuses found with conflict minerals. Now, technology companies are increasingly worried about \"the reputational risks\" of being connected with cobalt that might be mined by children and in dangerous conditions, the State Department official said. In recent weeks industry groups have unveiled\\xa0coordinated efforts to scrutinize their cobalt supply chains. The Responsible Cobalt Initiative is led by the China Chamber of Commerce for Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters, and supported by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Companies such as Apple, Samsung SDI and Sony have joined the initiative, along with Zhejiang Huayou, a Chinese company that buys cobalt from Congolese miners and was featured in The Post\\u2019s coverage. The Responsible Raw Materials Initiative was launched by the U.S.-based Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition. Nineteen companies, including Apple, Dell, Google, Honda, Microsoft and Ford, have signed on. The State Department official said the agency has discussed the initiatives with companies and industry groups and will closely monitor the progress.

       " 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/12/23/this-man-is-on-a-mission-to-fix-the-way-we-sleep/': (u'James Proud, founder of Hello. (Courtesy of Hello)  James Proud is a man on a mission to fix our sleep. \\xa0This one-time recipient of Peter Thiel\\'s \"skip-college-and-build-things-instead\" fellowship\\xa0is convinced that building gadgets for the home is the best way to improve our lives through tech. And improving sleep, he\\u2019s sure, is the place to start. His company, Hello, makes the Sense,\\xa0a glowing orb that pairs with a clip that you attach to your pillow and connects with a phone app. The system monitors the conditions in your bedroom and charts them\\xa0so that, over time, you get a better handle on what helps you improve your sleep. Proud\\'s sleep tracker is one of the latest devices to tackle what\\xa0the Centers for Disease Control has declared a \"public health problem\": insufficient sleep. Others have gotten into the act, including\\xa0Fitbit, Apple and its\\xa0\"bedtime\" feature, and many other apps. The desire for us to get better sleep is so great that sleep tech even has its own section at the tech industry\\u2019s CES trade show this year, for the first time in the show\\u2019s 50-year history. But Proud envisions something different for Hello. \\u201cWhen looking at all of the wearables, we saw that people were fascinated with their sleep. But for all of these wearable devices, it was tacked on,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo we said, let\\u2019s focus on that foundation. We have to go further than what you would do with a wearable device, and find out what\\u2019s going on in the room.\\u201d Sense gives you more information than just the number of hours you spend in bed.\\xa0Besides tracking your room\\'s conditions, the orb half of the system doubles\\xa0as a white noise machine and glowing alarm clock. The latest model can even take voice commands that will let you control the smart lights in your bedroom or lower the thermostat.    The clip on your pillow and orb on your nightstand help you monitor your sleep. (Courtesy of Hello)  I decided to try out Proud\\'s tracker, with the hopes of finally waving goodbye to the bags under my eyes. It\\u2019s been working for me, to varying degrees. I\\u2019ve used sleeping apps before, which require you to have your smartphone on or near your bed as you sleep -- directly contradicting the conventional wisdom that you shouldn\\u2019t have screens in bed. With Sense, I like that I can set up my alarms and white noise from the app on my phone before I sleep, and then leave my phone outside the bedroom. Plus, having a sensor clipped to my pillow means I don\\u2019t have to wear a wristband or headband to bed, which keeps sleep-tracking from being uncomfortable. Sense also helped me figure out the temperature that helps me drift off in peace. Our bedroom was always a little too hot. But Sense explained that opening my windows wasn\\u2019t helping because it raised the room\\u2019s humidity and worsened its air quality. Through trial and error, I found that switching on a fan in the room at least a half hour before I hit the hay is a better alternative. The sensor doesn\\'t always pick up everything accurately,\\xa0however, though it has improved over time -- \\xa0possibly in part because Sense lets you correct data you think is wrong. Still, just seeing the information about my bedtime habits helped me change for the better. \\xa0For example, I didn\\u2019t realize how often I was lying awake in bed -- or lingering in the morning -- until I started looking at the Sense data. While I thought I was only loitering in bed a day or two a week, it was actually much more of a habit than I thought it was. Similarly, I often thought I was only cheating on my unofficial bedtime a night or two a week, but it was four nights a week, aka, most days.\\xa0Now I\\u2019ve moved my target for bedtime back a half-hour and the overall quality of my sleep has gone up. I also found I went to bed later on Sundays, which always made Monday morning hit me like a ton of bricks.    I traveled a lot in October. (Screengrabs by Hayley Tsukayama)  Other changes have been a little more subtle. Sense tells you, for example, when you move around a lot in your sleep. Armed with that information, I started trying to figure out what made me restless, and managed to draw some conclusions by observing my own behavior. Eating too close to bedtime makes me more restless, as does not giving myself at least a half-hour to spin down from the day. Sense tries to help make those finer conclusions as well, for example, suggesting about what time I should stop drinking caffeine at night. Sense also provides what it calls a relative metric -- telling individuals how they rank among their peers -- to encourage people to change their habits, said\\xa0Matt Walker, a sleep researcher and Hello\\'s chief science officer. I personally didn\\'t find knowing, for example, that I woke up at a more consistent time than 68 percent of other people that motivating. But Walker said\\xa0that telling users how they\\'re sleeping as compared with other (anonymized) users is the best\\xa0way to change habits. Maybe if I were less consistent than 68 percent of people, I would feel differently. Of the Internet of Things things I\\u2019ve tried to fold into my daily life so far, Sense has done the best job of convincing me of its worth. It hasn\\'t completely fixed my sleep, and I won\\u2019t credit Sense alone for changing my habits. It provides good information, but, like every other sleep tracker I\\u2019ve tried, I had to act on the information for myself -- even with Sense\\u2019s little nudges.

(Cadillac)  The love affair between Cadillac and Donald Trump peaked\\xa0in the late 1980s, when they teamed up on a line of limousines called \\u201cthe Trump Series.\\u201d The most luxurious model came with black, Italian-leather seats, aircraft sound insulation, a television and VCR, a cellular telephone, 24-karat-gold plating, a hidden safe and a paper shredder. The car\\xa0stretched nearly 23\\xbd feet long. \\u201cI\\u2019m very honored that they built me the first one,\\u201d Trump said, unveiling the Golden Edition in 1988, \\u201cand, frankly, I deserve it.\\u201d Trump\\xa0has enjoyed a long and sometimes lucrative relationship\\xa0with Cadillac, the brand his father drove when Trump was a child. General Motors, which makes Cadillacs, was a regular advertiser on Trump's television show, \\u201cThe Apprentice,\\u201d where its products were sometimes featured in challenges for contestants. Cadillac\\xa0was a longtime sponsor of a golf tournament at a Trump-owned course in Florida. Trump, in turn, has appeared at launch events to promote GM vehicles on several occasions, including one for the 2015 Cadillac Escalade. Trump is now president-elect, and he has styled himself as a critic in chief of American companies that move factory jobs to foreign countries. On the campaign trail, he made a few mentions of GM,\\xa0which is in the middle of a $5 billion plan to expand production in Mexico. But the automaker\\xa0has largely escaped the worst of Trump's wrath. In a statement sent to reporters in June, Trump criticized\\xa0GM's Mexico expansion. \\u201cMany companies \\u2014 like Ford, General Motors, Nabisco, Carrier \\u2014 are moving production to Mexico,\\u201d the statement read. But in the version\\xa0of the statement posted to the campaign's website, the reference to GM\\xa0has been\\xa0removed. A GM spokesman said Trump has no business relationship with Cadillac. There is no evidence that his past relationships with GM have influenced his conduct as a candidate and president-elect. But the difference in how he has treated GM and, say, Ford \\u2014 both iconic Detroit automakers \\u2014 highlights a challenge Trump will face as president: how to avoid the appearance of playing favorites with companies he has done business with. Trump frequently criticized Ford on the campaign trail for its plans to move small-car production to Mexico. Last month, he announced that he had persuaded Ford not to move a production line of sport-utility vehicles from Kentucky to Mexico, a decision that the company and union officials said did not affect any American jobs. In a statement, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, said GM, \\u201calong with many other companies he is speaking to, will be encouraged to keep jobs here in the United States.\\u201d But Trump has not criticized GM for its plans to import an SUV built in China, or for large investments in production facilities in South Korea. He did not speak out when GM announced last month that it will lay off 2,000 workers at factories in Ohio and Michigan, nor when the company said\\xa0this week that it would lay off 1,300 workers in Detroit. (The company blamed both moves on softening U.S. demand for smaller cars and sedans; one of the sedans produced at the Ohio plant facing layoffs is the Cruze, which is produced, in hatchback form, in Mexico.) GM produces about 19 percent of the cars it sells in North America in Mexico, similar to the figure for Fiat-Chrysler, according to data from the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.; Ford produces about 12 percent there. There are GM plants at four locations in Mexico, and the company announced two years ago that new investments would create about 5,600 new positions for Mexican workers. GM also imports the Buick Envision from China, a decision that has drawn the ire of organized labor.\\xa0Workers have nicknamed the Envision the \\u201cInvasion.\\u201d On the campaign trail, Trump largely stayed mum on those decisions, even as he criticized Ford. For instance, in the opening minutes of his first debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump falsely claimed Ford had plans to lay off employees. \\u201cFord is leaving \\u2014 you see that,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cTheir small-car division \\u2014 thousands of jobs, leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.\\u201d While Ford does plan to relocate its small-car production to Mexico, the company said\\xa0its employees in the United States will continue working, building larger vehicles. One of the few moments when Trump mentioned GM on the trail\\xa0came in Grand Rapids, Mich. a week before the election. There, he used layoffs at one of the company's plants to attack not the company but his Democratic opponent. \\u201cGM laid off 314 workers at the Lake Orion assembly plant in 2013 because of imports from the South Korean trade deal pushed by Hillary,\\u201d Trump said. \\xa0 After winning the election, Trump appointed GM's chairman and chief executive,\\xa0Mary Barra, to an economic advisory panel.    Cadillac Vice President of Marketing Don Butler and Ivanka Trump pose at the release party for a luxury art book published by Assouline in New York in December 2012. (Cadillac).  In the past, Trump was\\xa0a regular at the automaker's events. In 2005, he appeared at the New York International Auto Show with Bob Lutz, then GM's vice chairman. The pair held\\xa0a news conference on the new Cadillac XLR-V, a muscle car, according to news reports. In 2013,\\xa0Donald and Melania Trump appeared\\xa0at the debut of the latest Escalade. The couple sat with Ed Welburn, then the company's vice president for global design. \\u201cI think they've done a great job, really great job. They've really done a fantastic job. We love it,\\u201d Trump said, according to footage of that event from Cadillac. Melody Lee, the director of brand marketing at Cadillac, said the company frequently invites \\u201ccelebrities and influencers\\u201d to its events. \\u201cIt's a standard process,\\u201d she said, \\u201cand the Trumps must have been on that invitation list.\\u201d Last year, his campaign told The Washington Post that a Cadillac Escalade was one of two American cars that Trump owned at the time, along with a Tesla. GM also promoted its products on \\u201cThe Apprentice,\\u201d his reality-television show. The Pontiac appeared on the show in 2005 and 2006, according to a statement from the company. Also in 2006, contestants were tasked with planning a three-hour training session for Chevrolet dealers, focused on the Tahoe. Luigi Zingales, an economist at the University of Chicago, said Trump's divergent treatment of GM and Ford on the stump raises the specter of government favoritism to specific companies, a practice economists generally believe can hurt the economy. \\u201cIt looks more and more [like] the behavior of a crony capitalist,\\u201d Zingales said. \\u201cThe issue is you don\\u2019t want to be in a country where the president picks and chooses who to blast and who to promote in completely arbitrary fashion.\\u201d Not every past partnership with Trump has worked out for GM. The Trump line of limos, for example, never really made it to the road. At the unveiling, Trump\\xa0called the car \\u201cthe ultimate limousine to be found anywhere in the world.\\u201d In his book \\u201cThe Art of the Deal,\\u201d Trump wrote that he received a \\u201cbeautiful gold Cadillac Allant\\xe9\\u201d as a gift from the company on completing the deal. GM says today that only three of the Trump-edition cars were ever produced. \\xa0\",\n",

Like the U.S., it was one of the world\\'s 10 richest countries at the turn of the last century. And also like the U.S., that made it a New World magnet for Old World immigrants. But unlike the U.S., that was as good as it ever got. There was no Argentinian Dream. Just a nearly never-ending nightmare of either falling behind gradually or falling behind suddenly. All of which was self-inflicted. Its fundamental problem was how unequal it was. About 300 families controlled most of the land, the economy, and the government. Everyone else was just a cog in their beef-and-grain-exporting machine. Or, as the Financial Times\\'s Alan Beattie has put it, Argentina is \"what North America might have looked\" like \"if the South had won the Civil War and gone on to dominate the North.\" Which is to say that it was a semi-feudal aristocracy dependent on a steady supply of cheap labor. If this sounds like a good way to start a class war, that\\'s because it was. Up until recently, Argentina had spent most of the last 100 years alternating between left-wing populists who promised to share the country\\'s wealth, and right-wing military dictatorships that tried to stop that from happening. And, of course, with the stakes so high, neither side was willing to play by the rules. The Peronists tried to tip elections in their favor by locking up the opposition\\'s leaders, shutting down their newspapers, and getting rid of unions that weren\\'t loyal to the regime. The army, meanwhile, didn\\'t bother with any kind of democratic pretense. It launched coup after coup after coup, outlawing the Peronist Party, and, in the 1970s, \"disappearing\" tens of thousands of activists and ordinary people too. Argentina is a reminder of one of the most forgotten caveats in history. Class struggle, Marx said, would either end \"in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large\" or \"in the common ruin of the contending classes.\" We might want to put a little more emphasis on that second part. Argentina, though,\\xa0hasn\\'t just been hurt by people fighting over power. It\\'s also been hurt by what people have done in power. Right-wing\\xa0governments had no interest in educating the workers or investing in anything other than the landowners\\' exports. And left-wing governments just nationalized industries, protected others with tariffs, and made promises they could only afford by printing money. The result was a century of inflation and stagnation. As The Economist points out, Argentina went from having an income per capita that was 92 percent of 16 of the richest countries in 1914 to just 43 percent today. The irony, of course, is that even when Argentina did open up its economy and try to cure its congenital inflation in the 1990s, the way it did so\\u2014pegging the peso to the dollar one-to-one\\u2014made it unable to respond to even the smallest shock. So when one came along, Argentina ended up in its own private Great Depression. The point is that nothing is inevitable. The arc of the political universe is long, and it doesn\\'t have to bend toward progress or justice or anything else good. It can point backwards if that\\'s where we aim it. And we might. Like Argentina, we have high levels of inequality. And also like Argentina, we have pretty extreme political polarization. But what really might make us like Argentina is if we have politicians who deride expertise, who think that policy is something that fits into 140 characters, and who hint that elections are only something you have to respect if you win. The United States, in other words, could still be Argentina.',\n",

That, after all, is what slapping a tariff on Chinese imports would mean. Just ask Beijing. They\\'ve already started to think about how they would retaliate if\\xa0he does do it. Not that markets have noticed. They\\'re blissfully unaware on the way to Dow 20,000, and what they hope is Trump\\'s tax cut nirvana. Indeed, they seem to believe that Trump\\'s tough line on China was either just a campaign ploy to help him in the Rust Belt, or else a proposal that has no chance of being passed by a Republican Congress. This is na\\xefve. First off, trade is one of the only two issues Trump really seems to care about, and has had a consistent position on. (The other is his open admiration for\\xa0authoritarian leaders, which dates back to his 1990 praise for the Tiananmen Square massacre\\u2014yes, the massacre itself). He\\'s always thought that other countries were taking advantage of us, whether that was Japan in 1988, or Mexico in 1998, or China in 2008, and that the only way to stop this was to rip up\\xa0our allegedly lopsided trade deals and start threatening to put tariffs up unless we got better ones. He talked about it a lot during the campaign. He means it. If this wasn\\'t clear before, it should be now that Trump has tapped economist Peter Navarro to lead the newly-created National Trade Council. Navarro has had a long and not-so-varied career of worrying about trade and war with China in books like, well,\\xa0\"Death By China,\" \"The Coming China Wars,\" and \"Crouching Tiger: What China\\'s Militarism Means for the Rest of the World.\" Indeed, he co-authored a white paper for the Trump campaign arguing that\\u2014this might sound familiar\\u2014we should use tariffs as a \"negotiating tool\" to force other countries, as\\xa0he\\'s said before, to stop using export subsidies, stop manipulating their currencies down, stop stealing our intellectual property, and stop using cost-competitive but pollution-heavy factories. The irony is there was actually a pretty good case for doing something like this when Navarro proposed it six years ago, but not anymore. That\\'s because China is already doing the things a tariff would supposedly\\xa0make it do. It has eliminated its export subsidies, spent a trillion dollars propping its currency up instead of pushing it down, and is taking real steps to make its air breathable again. But that doesn\\'t seem to matter much to Trump. He views everything, even a voluntary exchange like trade, as a deal where there\\'s a winner and a loser. In this case, the country that sells more than it buys abroad is the victor, and the other is the vanquished. Trump, then,\\xa0thinks that a trade deficit itself, more than, say, an undervalued currency, is proof enough that something must be done. And he doesn\\'t need Congress to help him do it, either. He can impose tariffs on his own using executive authority\\xa0under existing laws. There are already whispers he might do just that to put a 10 percent tariff on all imports. Don\\'t think you weren\\'t warned. You were, over, and over, and over again. Maybe we should listen?',\n",

So if he was rattled by his shaky performance in Monday\\u2019s loss to the Carolina Panthers \\u2014 it was the first game since the season-opening loss to Pittsburgh in which he didn\\u2019t throw a touchdown pass, and he twice turned the ball over \\u2014 there was no evidence when the Washington Redskins regrouped for their lone practice of the week in advance of Saturday\\u2019s game at the Chicago Bears. \\u201cNot my first time coming away from a tough loss,\\u201d said Cousins, who threw for 315 yards in the 26-15 defeat  while missing open receivers, throwing one interception and fumbling after getting blindsided on a sack on the opening play of the second half.

And what bearing, if any, will his performance in December have on negotiations for a long-term contract in the offseason? Cousins is the NFL\\u2019s sixth-rated quarterback behind Matt Ryan, Dak Prescott, Tom Brady, Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers. During the loss to Carolina, he set a Redskins record for passing yards in a season \\u2014 breaking his own record of 4,166, set a year ago. He has 4,360 yards with two games remaining. Still, some want more proof of his mettle after arguably his roughest outing of the season. Cousins\\u2019s teammates, for their part, have seen enough. \\u201cAll the faith in the world\\u201d is how running back Chris Thompson described his confidence in Cousins\\u2019s quarterbacking ability Thursday. Said left tackle Trent Williams, a co-captain of the offense: \\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t Kirk\\u2019s fault we lost [to Carolina]. We didn\\u2019t play well as a team. When our defense was playing well, our offense wasn\\u2019t playing well. Offensively, we had penalties, we had missed assignments, we had drops. You can\\u2019t pin everything on the quarterback. We didn\\u2019t play well as a whole. So there\\u2019s no confidence that\\u2019s lost in here.\\u201d Nearly every Redskins player was implicated in the loss to Carolina (6-8) at FedEx Field, where the home team was favored by a touchdown. Pass protection wasn\\u2019t as stout as Cousins had grown accustomed to, yet Cousins hurried his throws at times, as if giving the Panthers\\u2019 defensive front too much respect. The running game was \\u201catrocious,\\u201d to use Coach Jay Gruden\\u2019s word, contributing 29 yards (2.2\\xa0per carry) before it was largely abandoned, resulting yet again in a lopsided offensive script that consisted of 47 pass plays and 13\\xa0rushing plays. Otherwise reliable receivers dropped catchable balls \\u2014 Thompson among them. Tight end Jordan Reed wasn\\u2019t a factor, ailing from a shoulder separation and ultimately ejected. With the offense converting just 2 of 12 third downs (16.7\\xa0percent), the Redskins\\u2019 defense was left on the field for nearly 35\\xa0minutes, and the safeties were easily exploited. Most disconcerting, the Panthers took the Redskins\\u2019 home field with more fire than the host team. Despite having virtually no chance at making the playoffs, the Panthers competed as if the postseason hung in the balance. On some teams, that fighting ethic is steeped in the culture. On others, the head coach supplies it. Or a defensive captain. Or the quarterback. Gruden, in his third year on the job, is finding his moments to sound the code-red alarm or dress down his players for a subpar effort, as he did following the Week 13 loss at Arizona. Firing up the troops isn\\u2019t necessarily Cousins\\u2019s forte. He leads in a different manner, Thompson says. \\u201cThere are guys that are \\u2018rah-rah\\u2019 guys, that get loud and pump people up and slap people on the head. That\\u2019s Trent Williams; that\\u2019s his job, patting hands, hitting helmets \\u2014 all of that,\\u201d Thompson said. \\u201cThen Kirk comes in with his calm message before the game, at the end of practices. We can just feel how calm he is. It gives us that confidence because we know Kirk is ready to go. He\\u2019s wired up, and he\\u2019s prepared. That\\u2019s who he is; that\\u2019s how he plays. He\\u2019ll say, \\u2018Guys, we need to do this. We know what we can do. Let\\u2019s go out there and get it done.\\u2019 And that\\u2019s it.\\u201d But is it enough to push a team with obvious deficiencies to the playoffs? In Cousins\\u2019s view, it goes both ways. \\u201cAs a quarterback, it will always be a major role of mine to elevate the play of the other players in the huddle. If I step in the huddle and the 10 guys there are not going to play better as a result of me being in the huddle, then what am I doing? .\\u2009.\\u2009. You need to elevate the play of the guys around you,\\u201d Cousins said Thursday. \\u201cThat being said, we\\u2019re all professionals. We\\u2019re all grown men.

Sending racy American content into a country that censors almost everything may have seemed like a leap, but Netflix was confident. The China plan, Hastings\\xa0said, was on a \\u201cslow and steady path.\\u201d Less than a year later, having launched just about everywhere else,\\xa0Netflix shelved the streaming project.\\xa0It opted instead to license some content to Chinese providers for \\u201cmodest\\u201d revenue, according to a\\xa0quarterly letter.\\xa0(Representatives of the company declined to comment.)

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)  For some highflying U.S. Internet businesses, the China dream is fading; for others, it looks radically different from what they had hoped. California\\u2019s Internet companies once dreamed of liberating China with technology, thinking that the system of censorship known as the\\xa0Great Firewall would inevitably crumble like the Berlin Wall, paving the way for their advance in the world\\u2019s most populous nation. But President Xi Jinping has tightened, rather than loosened, control of the Internet and increased restrictions on foreign companies. Six years after Google\\xa0retreated from China\\u2019s search-engine business over censorship and hacking concerns, U.S. firms seem more willing than ever to play the Communist Party\\u2019s game \\u2014 they just can\\u2019t win it. Even if they can gain a foothold, which is hard enough, there is practically no way they will be able to overtake the Chinese companies that have comfortably established themselves. Facebook\\u2019s China charm offensive, which included Mark Zuckerberg studying Mandarin, has yielded little. Google\\u2019s search business and Twitter remain blocked. LinkedIn and\\xa0Microsoft censor \\u2014 and still, neither is a major player in China\\u2019s online space.\\xa0Amazon.com is sputtering along against the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. After great initial success, Apple is being overtaken by local upstarts. [Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.] Still, tech companies are pushing, and they are looking to the incoming Trump administration for help breaking in.  When executives from the major U.S. technology companies met with President-elect Donald Trump on Dec. 14 at Trump Tower, they complained about a Chinese proposal that would require foreign technology companies to deposit the source code for their software with the government, according to a person who was familiar with the discussions. Bill Bishop, a tech consultant who writes Sinocism, an influential China newsletter, said he has seen waves of confident California firms humbled by efforts to crack the China market.\\xa0 \\u201cEach generation believes they can find a way, but the Chinese Communist Party has upped their game in terms of censorship, and these companies that nobody has heard about 10 years ago \\u2014 now they are the biggest companies in the world,\\u201d he said,\\xa0referring to corporate behemoths such as Alibaba, Tencent, Xiaomi and Baidu, sometimes called the Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google of China. \\u201cU.S. companies are going to make a Chinese play, but not the way they imagined.\\u201d Thinking small  If you were looking for a symbol of downsized China dreams, it would be hard to do better than\\xa0Wuzhen, the luxe but isolated resort that plays host to China\\u2019s \\u201cWorld Internet Conference\\u201d each fall. The summit, in its third year, brings together an oddball cast which this year included Chinese Internet regulators, pro-censorship academics, the prime minister of Cambodia and emissaries from U.S. companies such as Amazon and Facebook. One of the most high-profile speakers was Reid Hoffman, the executive chairman of LinkedIn, who praised Xi\\u2019s signature infrastructure plan, a spending bonanza known as \\u201cOne Belt, One Road.\\u201d U.S. companies considering a China move often talk about the \\u201cLinkedIn model\\u201d \\u2014 a model that means close local ties and full cooperation with the government.\\xa0    Internet start-up employees work on their computers at 3W Coffee in Beijing. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)  Acting local \\u2014 or, indeed, operating at all \\u2014 means playing by local rules, even when those rules run counter to the idea of free expression and association. LinkedIn\\u2019s Chinese site\\xa0censors content and puts limits on forming groups. LinkedIn chief executive Jeff Weiner has described the company\\u2019s introduction of a Chinese-language version as involving \\u201ccompromises that are far from ideal and can be very painful.\\u201d LinkedIn did not agree to an interview for this article. Unlike when Google and Yahoo were hauled in to testify before Congress for censoring content a decade ago, LinkedIn\\u2019s censorship has earned the company a small amount of bad press, but has not been treated as a major story. LinkedIn\\u2019s bigger challenge is\\xa0competing in the Chinese market. Its Chinese site has more than 20 million users \\u2014 fair by U.S. standards, but diminutive for a Chinese social network, analysts said. To better connect with young workers, it launched an app called Chitu which promises to be \\u201creal and fun.\\u201d The app sounds millennial-friendly \\u2014 it hosts livestreams with celebrities, for instance \\u2014 but faces\\xa0fierce competition from homegrown challengers with a head start. Staying relatively small, saying the right things and complying with authorities seems to be the only option. Evernote, an organizational app, launched a China-specific version in 2012. In 2014, the app shelved a feature that Hong Kong protesters had used to share information in China. Like many U.S. companies doing business in China, Evernote has agreed to store Chinese citizens\\u2019 data on Chinese servers, where authorities can access it. It runs its China operation in a bright, foosball-equipped office in Beijing\\u2019s tech district. The business is chugging along but remains small, employing a couple of dozen people. That fact that both firms are cited as China success stories shows just how tough it is for U.S. businesses. Jeremy Goldkorn, director of the media and consulting firm Danwei, summed up the best-case scenario for U.S. Internet start-ups as \\u201cnot getting kicked out, but not making a lot of money.\\u201d Many large U.S. tech giants, from semiconductor companies to Apple, have made impressive profits in China, but it\\u2019s getting harder now, said Scott Kennedy, who directs a project on Chinese business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \\u201cThis is a market that makes or breaks companies.\\u201d Locked out  The titans of U.S. technology are facing some of the toughest challenges yet. Google and Facebook remain at the periphery, reduced to selling ads while they angle for a Communist Party-brokered compromise that could get them in. Over the past few years, Facebook has made a high-profile push to win over China\\u2019s leaders. When China\\u2019s former Web czar, Lu Wei,\\xa0toured Facebook\\u2019s office in 2014, a copy of Xi\\u2019s book, \\u201cThe Governance of China,\\u201d was visible on Zuckerberg\\u2019s desk. Last March, Zuckerberg braved Beijing\\u2019s toxic air to take a notorious \\u201csmog jog\\u201d through Tiananmen Square.\\xa0 Despite recent\\xa0reports that Facebook is building a \\u201ccensorship tool\\u201d to help secure access to the Chinese market, the social network remains blocked, with little chance of that changing anytime soon, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of its sensitivity. To comply with Chinese law and regulations, Facebook would need to drastically change its product, experts said. If the company were to secure the requisite permits to operate \\u2014 and that\\u2019s a big\\xa0if \\u2014 it\\u2019s not clear that it would succeed. In the years that Zuckerberg has been studying Mandarin, China\\u2019s government has ramped up its focus on innovation and helped build\\xa0an alternate universe where local technology rules.\\xa0 Facebook would need to compete, for instance, with Tencent\\u2019s WeChat, a chat service with more than 800 million active users that has morphed into one-stop shopping for socializing, news and e-commerce. \\u201cWhen I think about Facebook in China, I think, \\u2018What\\u2019s their advantage?\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d said William Bao Bean, a Shanghai-based partner at SOSV Ventures and the managing director of Chinaccelerator, which invests in start-ups. \\u201cTheir product is so outpaced by the local companies.\\u201d That does not mean Facebook won\\u2019t try. Tim Sparapani, who was Facebook\\u2019s first director of public policy and is now principal at SPQR strategies, said entering China was part of Zuckerberg\\u2019s vision and he \\u201cwouldn\\u2019t bet against Mark.\\u201d \\u201cIf Mark says he is going to connect the world, he is going to connect the world. It\\u2019s about fulfilling that vision of ubiquitous worldwide connectivity.\\u201d Facebook declined a request for comment. Carmen Chang, a partner at the Silicon Valley firm New Enterprise Associates and a longtime China dealmaker, said that ambitious companies such as Facebook will take the long view in China \\u2014 strengthening their ties and waiting for new opportunities. \\u201cChina is too important a market for these companies to settle for a Plan B,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThey will take what they can get and keep probing. Some companies will never give up.\\u201d  Others wonder why Silicon Valley stays optimistic. \\u201cThe people at the top are used to moving forward at cyber-speed, not to being pushed aside, blocked, for reasons that are not based on the technology or based on somebody having a better idea \\u2014 it\\u2019s just foreign to their way of thinking,\\u201d said Lester Ross, a managing partner at Wilmer Hale in Beijing, who advises U.S. and Chinese companies. \\u201cIf you can afford it, it\\u2019s patience and hope that things change. I don\\u2019t see signs of that in front of us in the near term,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt is very hard to be optimistic.\\u201d  Dwoskin reported from San Francisco.
